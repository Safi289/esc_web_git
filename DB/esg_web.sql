REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

Hess Corp, one of Exxonâ€™s partners in the block with a 30% stake, said in an earnings call last week that production had reached full capacity of 120,000 barrels per day (bpd).\r\n\r\nExxon said it would send the compressor to Germany for repairs, where it was set to arrive on Feb. 9.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe full extent of the damage will not be known until a detailed inspection of the compressor can take place at the workshop of the manufacturer, MAN Turbo in Germany,â€ the company said in a statement.\r\n\r\nExxon, which operates the Stabroek block, had last year limited output due to problems with the reinjection of natural gas. Guyanese authorities have said they expect the consortium not to routinely flare natural gas extracted alongside crude oil, heightening the importance of gas reinjection.\r\n\r\nThe consortium led by Exxon, in which Chinaâ€™s CNOOC Ltd also has a 25% stake, has made 18 discoveries in the Stabroek block totaling more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, making the South American country the worldâ€™s newest energy hotspot.\r\n\r\nProduction began in December 2019.', 0),

Without maintenance, the risk of glitches or unplanned outages increases and delays risk driving up the cost of work later - partly because there will be a rush to do maintenance when lockdowns ease, and partly because plants have lost the optimal timing and weather for work during the northern hemisphere spring.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen the virus and the quarantine measures have been eased and it is safe to get back to work, it doesnâ€™t mean the same work can be done with the same intensity because the weather windows could be missed and that can push maintenance even to the next year,â€ said Matthew Fitzsimmons, Vice President of the Oilfield Service team at research firm Rystad.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, companies which service the oil industry are being hit by the lack of work.\r\n\r\nâ€œA lot of service companies are not getting the revenues they had otherwise expected in 2020. That is going to have a huge impact on the health of the service industry,â€ said Fitzsimmons.\r\n\r\nA MAJOR HEADACHE\r\n\r\nOil and gas companies involved in exploration and production spent an average of $80 billion a year on maintenance between 2015 and 2019, according to Rystad.\r\n\r\nThe industry typically takes advantage of periods of slow demand to do repair work but with oil prices nearly halved since the start of the year, this is no ordinary trough. Companies, many of them lumbered with high debts, are slashing all but the most essential work.\r\n\r\nSome units were shut down for maintenance but the work never started according to Amanda Fairfax, downstream oil market analyst at Genscape, a firm that monitors refineries activities with cameras.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey donâ€™t want either to invest the capital expenditure into the maintenance project or they donâ€™t want to have as many contract workers on sites as the additional influx of workforce might compromise people who have to remain at the refinery as essential personnel,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nA large maintenance programme in Russiaâ€™s Far East Sakhalin-2 project faces delays as the firm could not get pre-ordered pieces of machinery, two sources told Reuters.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere was a major headache with parts manufactured in China.

But others are less optimistic.\r\n\r\nA maintenance and development operation at an onshore field in Nigeria was delayed for months as the local oil firm could not receive equipment on time, a company source told Reuters.\r\n\r\nOil companies across Nigeria have also struggled to move workers to where they are needed due to lockdowns that vary by state, and regulations from the petroleum regulator limiting the number of workers at any oil site is also complicating operations. Rivers state, home to the oil hub of Port Harcourt, is under a lockdown so strict that the governor arrested 22 oil workers who landed there, despite federal government permits allowing them to travel.\r\n\r\nThe Rivers movement restrictions have also trapped pipes and other needed materials that are needed at oil fields outside the state, industry sources told Reuters.\r\n\r\n(Graphic: Impact of Covid-19 on European refineries - )', 0),

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0);

(11, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Direct, from manufacturing', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

Production of single-use plastics is set to grow 30% in the next five years, fuelling their contribution to global warming and ocean pollution, researchers said on Tuesday as they published a list of companies that manufacture and fund throwaway plastic.\r\n\r\nThe first â€œPlastic Waste Makers Indexâ€, published by the Australia-based philanthropic Minderoo Foundation, calculated that 20 companies - mainly energy and chemicals giants - are the source of half of the worldâ€™s single-use plastic waste.\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastics - such as face masks, medical equipment, shopping bags, coffee cups and cling film - are made from polymers, which use fossil fuels as a base material.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, 130 million metric tonnes of single-use plastics were thrown away around the world, with 35% burned, 31% buried in managed landfills and 19% dumped directly on land or into the ocean, said a report on the index.\r\n\r\nThe index used a range of data sources to track the flow of single-use plastic materials through their life cycle - from polymer form to finished goods to waste - and estimated where they were produced, converted, consumed and disposed of.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil topped the index of polymer producers generating single-use plastic waste, contributing 5.9 million tonnes in 2019, according to the report developed with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie and researchers at think-tanks and universities.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil said in emailed comments it â€œshares societyâ€™s concern about plastic waste and agrees it must be addressedâ€, requiring a collaborative effort between business, governments, green groups and consumers.\r\n\r\nIt added that it was taking action to address plastic waste by increasing recyclability, backing efforts to recover more plastic waste and working on advanced recycling solutions that could help lower greenhouse gas emissions linked to products.\r\n\r\nThe report said nearly 60% of the commercial finance for the single-use plastic industry comes from 20 global banks that have loaned almost $30 billion for polymer production since 2011.\r\n\r\nIn a foreword, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said the climate and plastic waste crises are â€œincreasingly intertwinedâ€, with the atmosphere treated like an â€œopen sewerâ€ for planet-heating emissions and the ocean like a â€œliquid landfillâ€ for plastic waste.\r\n\r\nBut as the electricity and transport sectors transition to clean energy, the companies that extract and sell fossil fuels are â€œscrambling to massively expandâ€ their petrochemicals market, three-quarters of which is plastic production, he wrote.\r\n\r\nâ€œSince most plastic is made from oil and gas â€“ especially fracked gas â€“ the production and consumption of plastic are becoming a significant driver of the climate crisis, already producing greenhouse gas emissions on the same scale as a large country,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nAcademic estimates of the carbon footprint of plastics have indicated the whole life cycle of single-use plastics accounted for about 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, with polymers the main contributor, the report authors said.\r\n\r\nOn their current growth path, single-use plastics could be responsible for 5-10% of annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 if the world meets the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, they added.\r\n\r\nThe Minderoo Foundation said petrochemicals companies should be required to disclose their â€œplastic waste footprintâ€ and commit to producing plastics from recycled plastic waste rather than fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nIt also called on banks and investors to shift their money away from companies that produce new fossil fuel-based virgin plastics to those that use recycled plastic feedstocks.\r\n\r\nSam Fankhauser, professor of climate change economics and policy at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Smith School and a contributor to the report, said making clear the roles different companies play in the plastics value chain was important because most pressure so far has centred on retailers.\r\n\r\nA plastic bag, for example, does not show the name of the petrochemicals firm that made its main ingredient but rather the supermarket whose goods it is designed to carry, he noted.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe just donâ€™t know enough about that chain - that allows people to hide behind it,â€ he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\r\n\r\nGreater transparency and disclosure by companies and banks of their involvement in producing or financing single-use plastics could encourage consumers and then shareholders to start pushing for action, as seen with climate change, he added.', 0),

The mayors of 12 big cities in North America, Europe and Africa pledged on Tuesday to shift their money out of fossil fuels and into green energy, buildings, transport and other investments to help them recover from the pandemic and tackle climate change.\r\n\r\nThe group of cities, which signed up to a declaration committing them to divest from coal, oil and gas, are home to more than 36 million residents and hold over $295 billion in assets.\r\n\r\nLed by London and New York City, they agreed to take all possible steps to divest from fossil fuel companies the assets that they control directly, while also calling on pension funds managing their money to do the same.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s time for cities to ditch fossil fuel investments and accelerate green investments that drive low-carbon jobs,â€ said London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn London, we have demonstrated that divestment is possible and indeed essential for our future,â€ he added in a statement.\r\n\r\nKhan committed in 2016 to work with the London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA) - the cityâ€™s largest local government pension provider - to move its assets out of fossil fuel firms.\r\n\r\nThe authority has since reduced its holdings in companies including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Coal India.\r\n\r\nThe share of the LPFAâ€™s assets invested in climate-polluting businesses has dropped from 1%, or Â£43.6 million ($56 million), to about 0.2% now, according to the Greater London Authority.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the LPFA has increased its green investments from Â£93 million to about Â£135 million, representing close to 3% of its assets today, city hall officials said.\r\n\r\nShirley Rodrigues, Londonâ€™s deputy mayor for environment and energy, said the aim was to divest 100% of the cityâ€™s pension funds from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nBut she noted that many cities, like London, have limited control over the management of their assets and cannot achieve a transformation overnight.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe key thing is understanding where your portfolio is and where you can act, and then taking those steps (to divest),â€ she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\r\n\r\nCities can find guidance on how to do that in a toolkit launched by London and New York last year, she added.\r\n\r\nThe other cities joining the divestment declaration are: Berlin, Bristol in England, South Africaâ€™s Cape Town and Durban, Los Angeles, Milan, New Orleans, Oslo, Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\r\n\r\nDurban Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said the city - officially called eThekwini - had embedded its divestment commitment in a new climate action plan announced this month.\r\n\r\nThe funds freed up by the move would be used to help small and medium businesses, social enterprises and co-operatives to participate in the green economy, he added in written comments.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL SENSE\r\n\r\nThe C40 network of cities working on climate action - a group nearly all of the divesting cities belong to - said it was not possible to give an exact figure of how much will be divested from fossil-fuel companies across the 12 signatory cities.\r\n\r\nThat is because the proportion of fossil-fuel holdings within total assets varies for each city, and the decision-making power often lies with pension fund managers, over which cities have differing levels of influence, C40 said.\r\n\r\nBut greening investments made financial as well as climate sense, the group said in a statement.\r\n\r\nEurope-based sustainable funds are estimated to yield average returns of 6.9% per year, compared with 6.3% for traditionally invested funds, according to investment firm Morningstar, C40 noted.\r\n\r\nVancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said that his city council had passed a motion in 2019 committing to responsibly divest city funds and staff pensions from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œCities like Vancouver play a key role in creating forward-looking policies that transition us from fossil-fuel dependency to renewable energy and a less energy-intensive future,â€ the Canadian mayor said in the C40 statement.\r\n\r\nRodrigues said London sought to incorporate climate action throughout its policies - from housing to creating employment in new areas such as retrofitting buildings to save on energy, and expanding electrification of transport.\r\n\r\nIt also works to persuade private financial institutions based in the city to put more capital into low-carbon investments through instruments like green bonds or the London Energy Efficiency Fund set up by the mayor, she said.\r\n\r\nWhile some cities need time to put in place the necessary conditions to shift their assets out of fossil fuels, â€œthe willingness is thereâ€, she added.\r\n\r\n($1 = 0.7783 pounds)', 0),

Activist investors are pushing it to lessen its reliance on fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe priority right now is to rebuild the balance sheet,â€ Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a media call following a virtual analysts day that emphasized the companyâ€™s commitment to lower spending and reducing debt, which has ballooned to $67.6 billion from $37.8 billion two years earlier.\r\n\r\nThat said, some analysts criticized Exxonâ€™s spending plans, saying the companyâ€™s focus is likely to shift more to oil than gas, unlike rivals Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell. It is also taking a measured approach to spending in its low-carbon group as other global oil giants aggressively move towards renewable projects.\r\n\r\nWoods reaffirmed plans to keep annual project spending at or below $19 billion in 2021 and between $20 billion and $25 billion through 2025. Production will remain largely flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Woods had planned to hike spending to as much as $35 billion per year to build production, but has reversed course after costly misfires on U.S. shale and Canadian oil sands.\r\n\r\nShares rose 0.8% to $56.52. The stock is up more than a third this year, but over the longer term trails broader averages.\r\n\r\nOil and gas production spending will focus on Guyana, Brazil and U.S. shale oil. The company expects its 400,000 barrels of daily output in west Texas and New Mexico to rise to about 700,000 by 2025, â€œbased on market conditions,â€ said Senior Vice President Neil Chapman.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\r\n\r\nDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil majors are at the sharp end of the climate debate and face a bewildering balancing act to secure their futures.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a Catch-22 situation: to meet ambitious emissions targets by investing in low-carbon technologies, they will have to rely on revenue from expanding their businesses in oil and gas, for which there is still growing global demand.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, they must satisfy the big investors who are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters; yet on the other, they canâ€™t risk cutting the generous dividends that keep shareholders sweet.\r\n\r\nHow energy companies navigate this maze could determine the winners and losers in a lower-carbon future, and help govern whether the world can rein in warming. So no pressure, then.\r\n\r\nThe confusion has been thrown into stark relief this week at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where oil majors, state oil giants and ministers have been debating behind closed doors in their biggest gathering of the year.\r\n\r\nWhile climate activists, notably Greta Thunberg, have called for all fossil fuel production to be halted to avert catastrophe, U.S President Donald Trump has decried â€œprophets of doomâ€ and hailed the economic importance of oil and gas.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt feels like we are at the epicenter of this debate. We sit right there between energy needs and climate change,â€ said Al Cook, executive vice-president of Norwayâ€™s energy giant Equinor.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you listen to Davos speeches, youâ€™ve got some people who say only economic growth and energy matter. Others ask to stop oil and gas immediately. We need to find a way to balance this but the challenge is that you cannot always be popular with either side,â€ Cook told Reuters.\r\n\r\nCLEAN ENERGY: FRACTION OF CAPEX\r\n\r\nRepsol is at the vanguard of an industry climate drive, announcing this year that it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. As a result, Norwayâ€™s wealth fund has doubled its stake in the Spanish energy firm.\r\n\r\nEquinor has meanwhile launched a target to reduce emissions to near zero in Norwegian offshore production by 2050, and is co-investing in a $10 billion wind farm in Britain, the worldâ€™s largest.\r\n\r\nFrench oil major Total this year announced investments into one of the worldâ€™s largest solar power plants, in Qatar. It also plans to open 20,000 power charging points in the Netherlands and invest in planting millions of trees in Peru.\r\n\r\nEuropeâ€™s top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Shell has set out an â€œambitionâ€ to halve â€œScope 3â€ emissions by 2050 from fuels and products sold to customers rather than from its own operations.\r\n\r\nReuters reported this week that BP is also looking to significantly broaden its targets.\r\n\r\nCompanies might tout green credentials to satisfy sustainable investors and activists, but how can they pay the bill?\r\n\r\nFatih Birol the head of the International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog for industrialized nations, said the reality was that industry investments in clean energy represented a small fraction of their spending.\r\n\r\nâ€œLast year only 1% of total capex went into clean technologies. But those investments will grow as companies have to balance their short-term profit goals with long-term social license,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œSome companies wonâ€™t need to borrow more, some companies may need to borrow more, but no company will stay unaffected by the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nHe said the industry would focus in coming years on reducing methane emissions from their own operations, which constitute 15% of all global greenhouse emissions.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis part can be done relatively inexpensively,â€ he added. â€œThe more expensive part will include carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and increased use of hydrogen.â€\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMP EFFECT\r\n\r\nAnother major challenge to climate action is a lack of a global consensus.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, where Trump is encouraging oil and gas production and has exited the Paris climate deal, oil majors lag their European rivals on emissions goals. Chevron has set limited reduction targets while ExxonMobil has no targets.\r\n\r\nA U.S. energy boom has helped make the country one of the worldâ€™s biggest gas flarers.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,â€ said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum.\r\n\r\nJafar argues that if the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, would need incentives to switch from cheaper coal, he said.\r\n\r\nBirol also said coal-fired plants were the main global source of emissions. â€œThe problem is how to address this coal issue without hurting those developing countries.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThe efforts of the West will be futile without bringing on board Asia and Africa, which are driving the growth in energy demand and emissions,â€ Jafar added.\r\n\r\nRichard Herrington, head of earth sciences at Londonâ€™s National History Museum also said a speedy energy transition may simply be impossible.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf the UK were to turn tomorrow all of its cars into electric ones, we would need twice the world annual cobalt and half of annual copper production,â€ he said. â€œYou can imagine what happens if you scale it up to the whole world.â€', 0),

They do not reflect the views of Reuters News, which, under the Trust Principles, is committed to integrity, independence, and freedom from bias. Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0);

(21, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-oil-recycling-idUSKBN2EZ1EF', '2021-07-29 11:09:40', NULL, NULL, 'Switching to low-carbon or no-carbon fuel sources', 'Special Report-The Recycling Myth: Big Oilâ€™s solution for plastic waste littered with failure', 'BOISE, Idaho (Reuters) - In early 2018, residents of Boise, Idaho were told by city officials that a breakthrough technology could transform their hard-to-recycle plastic waste into low-polluting fuel. The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

(26, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Total, from manufacturing', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\r\n\r\nThe top U.S. oil producer incurred a historic loss of $22.4 billion last year and is trying to convince a skeptical Wall Street that it can rebound after years of overspending left it deeply indebted and lagging behind rivals better geared for a world demanding cleaner fuels.\r\n\r\nExxon last year fell out of the Dow Jones index of top U.S. companies and shares fell to a two-decade low. Activist investors are pushing it to lessen its reliance on fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe priority right now is to rebuild the balance sheet,â€ Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a media call following a virtual analysts day that emphasized the companyâ€™s commitment to lower spending and reducing debt, which has ballooned to $67.6 billion from $37.8 billion two years earlier.\r\n\r\nThat said, some analysts criticized Exxonâ€™s spending plans, saying the companyâ€™s focus is likely to shift more to oil than gas, unlike rivals Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell. It is also taking a measured approach to spending in its low-carbon group as other global oil giants aggressively move towards renewable projects.\r\n\r\nWoods reaffirmed plans to keep annual project spending at or below $19 billion in 2021 and between $20 billion and $25 billion through 2025. Production will remain largely flat at around 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day.\r\n\r\nPreviously, Woods had planned to hike spending to as much as $35 billion per year to build production, but has reversed course after costly misfires on U.S. shale and Canadian oil sands.\r\n\r\nShares rose 0.8% to $56.52. The stock is up more than a third this year, but over the longer term trails broader averages.\r\n\r\nOil and gas production spending will focus on Guyana, Brazil and U.S. shale oil. The company expects its 400,000 barrels of daily output in west Texas and New Mexico to rise to about 700,000 by 2025, â€œbased on market conditions,â€ said Senior Vice President Neil Chapman. Two years ago, it forecast 1 million barrels per day in the Permian as early as 2024.\r\n\r\nOverall output is likely â€œto steadily shift from gas to liquids, which is at odds with most peers,â€ said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets.\r\n\r\nExxon vowed to increase its investments in carbon capture and storage as part of a new low-carbon business. Such efforts will account for about 3% of new spending, Exxon said, up from 1% previously.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt is still far from the double-digit levels of companies such as Shell and Total,â€ said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James.\r\n\r\nExxon expects $2 billion of a proposed $3 billion in savings from workforce reductions and efficiencies, said Andrew Swiger, chief financial officer.

They do not reflect the views of Reuters News, which, under the Trust Principles, is committed to integrity, independence, and freedom from bias. Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Reuters Professional has an agreement with Signal to publish stories based on these datasets.\r\n\r\n<<', 0),

REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastic consumption has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO. Face masks and latex gloves are washing up daily on Asiaâ€™s remote beaches. Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging.\r\n\r\nThe new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study.\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

REUTERS/Nick Oxford\r\n\r\nBut smaller independent oil drillers without the resources of big corporations were more worried about Bidenâ€™s vow to toughen regulations and stop issuing new permits on federal lands, part of his sweeping plan to combat climate change and bring the economy to net zero emissions by 2050.\r\n\r\nFederal lands are the source of about 10% of U.S. oil and gas supply. Fossil fuels produced on federally managed lands and waters contribute nearly 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to government estimates, making them an easy target for the administrationâ€™s climate agenda.\r\n\r\nBidenâ€™s pledge would reverse former President Donald Trumpâ€™s efforts to maximize drilling and mining on federal property. In an order dated Wednesday, the Biden administration suspended oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days while it reviews the legal and policy implications of the mineral leasing program. But a freeze or ban will not end production in those areas overnight.\r\n\r\nThe seven companies that control half the federal supply onshore in the Lower 48 states have leases and permits in hand that could last years.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have always been very confident that we will continue to develop and drill on federal acreage,â€ said David Hager, executive chairman of Devon Energy Corp, the biggest oil producer on onshore federal land in the Lower 48 states. â€œItâ€™s embedded into the rights we have in the leases and weâ€™re doing it the right way.â€\r\n\r\nHe said he expected the companyâ€™s federal lands permits would last at least four years.\r\n\r\nOther top producers on federal land include EOG Resources Inc, ExxonMobil Corp, Occidental Petroleum Corp, ConocoPhillips, and Mewbourne Oil Company.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives at these companies did not comment for this article. But several have issued public statements saying they have solid stockpiles of federal permits and an ability to meet tougher emissions regulations expected under Biden. They have also said they can quickly shift drilling to state or private acreage once federal permits dry up.\r\n\r\nEOG has said it has at least four years of federal permits. â€œWhen it comes to access to federal lands, thatâ€™s one of the things weâ€™re not really worried about in our business. We have a lot of potential outside of federal land, too,â€ Chief Operating Officer Billy Helms said during an investor conference last year.\r\n\r\nOccidental said last year it had well over 200 federal drilling permits in hand and had requested another roughly 200 permits on New Mexico acreage, where some of the richest reserves lie beneath federally owned property.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\r\n\r\nAmeredev II, which produces about 10,000 barrels of oil per day in New Mexicoâ€™s Permian, also has federal drilling permits to last at least four years.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re trying to maximize our value against an uncertain range of possibilities,â€ said CEO Parker Reese.\r\n\r\nEnergy consultancy Rystad said it saw stockpiling of federal lands drilling permits in the run-up to the November presidential election, with federal permit requests rising to a 31% share of all permit requests in the major U.S. oilfields from 18% in 2019.\r\n\r\nBidenâ€™s team did not respond to several requests for comment.\r\n\r\nMost onshore federal drilling happens in Western states like New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming, which get a share of extraction royalties and depend on that revenue.\r\n\r\nAs Biden takes office, U.S. shale drilling industry has already declined sharply due to weak prices.\r\n\r\nTotal U.S. shale output is expected to fall to 7.5 million barrels per day in February, the U.S. Energy Department said on Tuesday, which would be the lowest since June 2020.\r\n\r\nShale drilling accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. crude oil production, but output is expected to decline throughout 2021 as producers rein in spending.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EXISTENTIAL THREATâ€™\r\n\r\nA large swathe of the industry is made up of smaller firms that lack the deep pockets to squirrel away permits, get a jumpstart on installing new emissions control technologies or take their business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe impact on the independent oilman is a heck of a lot greater than it is on Big Oil,â€ said Don Law, owner of Denver-based Prima Exploration Inc, which produces about half of its 1,000 barrels of oil a day on federal lands, mainly in Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota.\r\n\r\nLaw called Bidenâ€™s promised policy â€œan existential threatâ€ unlike any he has encountered in 40 years in the oil business, echoing the rhetoric used by some climate activists about the threat posed by global warming.\r\n\r\nMany smaller drilling firms operate in a single state or basin, according to trade group Western Energy Alliance, and would struggle to pack up and leave.\r\n\r\nâ€œI actually live here,â€ said Mark Murphy, a third-generation oilman in New Mexico. His company, Strata Production Co, has 15 employees and operates 47 wells, mostly on federal acreage.\r\n\r\nWestern Energy Alliance, the oil and gas industry trade group most focused on public lands policy, has pledged to fight any efforts to impose a leasing ban in court. States that rely heavily on revenues from federal oil and gas drilling are also ramping up opposition.\r\n\r\nLast month Wyoming officials issued a study that said a ban would cost eight Western states $8.1 billion in tax revenue and $34.1 billion in investment in the next five years. The stateâ€™s governor, Mark Gordon, called the predictions â€œdevastating.â€\r\n\r\nNew Mexicoâ€™s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said in late 2019 that she would seek a waiver from any drilling ban imposed by a future administration. But she has not discussed the issue publicly since, and her office did not respond to several requests for comment.', 0);

Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.

Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\r\n\r\nDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil majors are at the sharp end of the climate debate and face a bewildering balancing act to secure their futures.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a Catch-22 situation: to meet ambitious emissions targets by investing in low-carbon technologies, they will have to rely on revenue from expanding their businesses in oil and gas, for which there is still growing global demand.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, they must satisfy the big investors who are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters; yet on the other, they canâ€™t risk cutting the generous dividends that keep shareholders sweet.\r\n\r\nHow energy companies navigate this maze could determine the winners and losers in a lower-carbon future, and help govern whether the world can rein in warming. So no pressure, then.\r\n\r\nThe confusion has been thrown into stark relief this week at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where oil majors, state oil giants and ministers have been debating behind closed doors in their biggest gathering of the year.\r\n\r\nWhile climate activists, notably Greta Thunberg, have called for all fossil fuel production to be halted to avert catastrophe, U.S President Donald Trump has decried â€œprophets of doomâ€ and hailed the economic importance of oil and gas.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt feels like we are at the epicenter of this debate. We sit right there between energy needs and climate change,â€ said Al Cook, executive vice-president of Norwayâ€™s energy giant Equinor.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you listen to Davos speeches, youâ€™ve got some people who say only economic growth and energy matter. Others ask to stop oil and gas immediately. We need to find a way to balance this but the challenge is that you cannot always be popular with either side,â€ Cook told Reuters.\r\n\r\nCLEAN ENERGY: FRACTION OF CAPEX\r\n\r\nRepsol is at the vanguard of an industry climate drive, announcing this year that it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. As a result, Norwayâ€™s wealth fund has doubled its stake in the Spanish energy firm.\r\n\r\nEquinor has meanwhile launched a target to reduce emissions to near zero in Norwegian offshore production by 2050, and is co-investing in a $10 billion wind farm in Britain, the worldâ€™s largest.\r\n\r\nFrench oil major Total this year announced investments into one of the worldâ€™s largest solar power plants, in Qatar. It also plans to open 20,000 power charging points in the Netherlands and invest in planting millions of trees in Peru.\r\n\r\nEuropeâ€™s top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Shell has set out an â€œambitionâ€ to halve â€œScope 3â€ emissions by 2050 from fuels and products sold to customers rather than from its own operations.\r\n\r\nReuters reported this week that BP is also looking to significantly broaden its targets.\r\n\r\nCompanies might tout green credentials to satisfy sustainable investors and activists, but how can they pay the bill?\r\n\r\nFatih Birol the head of the International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog for industrialized nations, said the reality was that industry investments in clean energy represented a small fraction of their spending.\r\n\r\nâ€œLast year only 1% of total capex went into clean technologies. But those investments will grow as companies have to balance their short-term profit goals with long-term social license,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œSome companies wonâ€™t need to borrow more, some companies may need to borrow more, but no company will stay unaffected by the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nHe said the industry would focus in coming years on reducing methane emissions from their own operations, which constitute 15% of all global greenhouse emissions.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis part can be done relatively inexpensively,â€ he added. â€œThe more expensive part will include carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and increased use of hydrogen.â€\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMP EFFECT\r\n\r\nAnother major challenge to climate action is a lack of a global consensus.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, where Trump is encouraging oil and gas production and has exited the Paris climate deal, oil majors lag their European rivals on emissions goals. Chevron has set limited reduction targets while ExxonMobil has no targets.\r\n\r\nA U.S. energy boom has helped make the country one of the worldâ€™s biggest gas flarers.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,â€ said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum.\r\n\r\nJafar argues that if the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, would need incentives to switch from cheaper coal, he said.\r\n\r\nBirol also said coal-fired plants were the main global source of emissions. â€œThe problem is how to address this coal issue without hurting those developing countries.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThe efforts of the West will be futile without bringing on board Asia and Africa, which are driving the growth in energy demand and emissions,â€ Jafar added.\r\n\r\nRichard Herrington, head of earth sciences at Londonâ€™s National History Museum also said a speedy energy transition may simply be impossible.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf the UK were to turn tomorrow all of its cars into electric ones, we would need twice the world annual cobalt and half of annual copper production,â€ he said. â€œYou can imagine what happens if you scale it up to the whole world.â€', 0),

Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.

They do not reflect the views of Reuters News, which, under the Trust Principles, is committed to integrity, independence, and freedom from bias. Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers.

The mayors of 12 big cities in North America, Europe and Africa pledged on Tuesday to shift their money out of fossil fuels and into green energy, buildings, transport and other investments to help them recover from the pandemic and tackle climate change.\r\n\r\nThe group of cities, which signed up to a declaration committing them to divest from coal, oil and gas, are home to more than 36 million residents and hold over $295 billion in assets.\r\n\r\nLed by London and New York City, they agreed to take all possible steps to divest from fossil fuel companies the assets that they control directly, while also calling on pension funds managing their money to do the same.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s time for cities to ditch fossil fuel investments and accelerate green investments that drive low-carbon jobs,â€ said London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn London, we have demonstrated that divestment is possible and indeed essential for our future,â€ he added in a statement.\r\n\r\nKhan committed in 2016 to work with the London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA) - the cityâ€™s largest local government pension provider - to move its assets out of fossil fuel firms.\r\n\r\nThe authority has since reduced its holdings in companies including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Coal India.\r\n\r\nThe share of the LPFAâ€™s assets invested in climate-polluting businesses has dropped from 1%, or Â£43.6 million ($56 million), to about 0.2% now, according to the Greater London Authority.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the LPFA has increased its green investments from Â£93 million to about Â£135 million, representing close to 3% of its assets today, city hall officials said.\r\n\r\nShirley Rodrigues, Londonâ€™s deputy mayor for environment and energy, said the aim was to divest 100% of the cityâ€™s pension funds from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nBut she noted that many cities, like London, have limited control over the management of their assets and cannot achieve a transformation overnight.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe key thing is understanding where your portfolio is and where you can act, and then taking those steps (to divest),â€ she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\r\n\r\nCities can find guidance on how to do that in a toolkit launched by London and New York last year, she added.\r\n\r\nThe other cities joining the divestment declaration are: Berlin, Bristol in England, South Africaâ€™s Cape Town and Durban, Los Angeles, Milan, New Orleans, Oslo, Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\r\n\r\nDurban Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said the city - officially called eThekwini - had embedded its divestment commitment in a new climate action plan announced this month.\r\n\r\nThe funds freed up by the move would be used to help small and medium businesses, social enterprises and co-operatives to participate in the green economy, he added in written comments.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL SENSE\r\n\r\nThe C40 network of cities working on climate action - a group nearly all of the divesting cities belong to - said it was not possible to give an exact figure of how much will be divested from fossil-fuel companies across the 12 signatory cities.\r\n\r\nThat is because the proportion of fossil-fuel holdings within total assets varies for each city, and the decision-making power often lies with pension fund managers, over which cities have differing levels of influence, C40 said.\r\n\r\nBut greening investments made financial as well as climate sense, the group said in a statement.\r\n\r\nEurope-based sustainable funds are estimated to yield average returns of 6.9% per year, compared with 6.3% for traditionally invested funds, according to investment firm Morningstar, C40 noted.\r\n\r\nVancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said that his city council had passed a motion in 2019 committing to responsibly divest city funds and staff pensions from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œCities like Vancouver play a key role in creating forward-looking policies that transition us from fossil-fuel dependency to renewable energy and a less energy-intensive future,â€ the Canadian mayor said in the C40 statement.\r\n\r\nRodrigues said London sought to incorporate climate action throughout its policies - from housing to creating employment in new areas such as retrofitting buildings to save on energy, and expanding electrification of transport.\r\n\r\nIt also works to persuade private financial institutions based in the city to put more capital into low-carbon investments through instruments like green bonds or the London Energy Efficiency Fund set up by the mayor, she said.\r\n\r\nWhile some cities need time to put in place the necessary conditions to shift their assets out of fossil fuels, â€œthe willingness is thereâ€, she added.\r\n\r\n($1 = 0.7783 pounds)', 0);

(45, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-oil-recycling-idUSKBN2EZ1EF', '2021-07-29 11:09:40', NULL, NULL, 'Building efficient factories to reduce carbon footprint', 'Special Report-The Recycling Myth: Big Oilâ€™s solution for plastic waste littered with failure', 'BOISE, Idaho (Reuters) - In early 2018, residents of Boise, Idaho were told by city officials that a breakthrough technology could transform their hard-to-recycle plastic waste into low-polluting fuel. The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),
(46, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Building efficient factories to reduce carbon footprint', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil companyâ€™s transition to cleaner fuels.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Exxonâ€™s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nExxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nThe reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxonâ€™s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said.\r\n\r\nSince the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxonâ€™s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,â€ Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.â€\r\n\r\nFurther goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said.\r\n\r\nâ€˜NOTABLE TURNâ€™\r\n\r\nThe targets are â€œencouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,â€ said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.â€\r\n\r\nThe new targets do not address product emissions, a â€œmain source of risk,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. â€œAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.â€\r\n\r\nExxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.\r\n\r\nLast week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels. Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management.\r\n\r\nIn May, Exxonâ€™s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock Inc, voted in favor of an independent chairman and against the re-election of two directors over Exxonâ€™s approach to climate risks.', 0),

Production of single-use plastics is set to grow 30% in the next five years, fuelling their contribution to global warming and ocean pollution, researchers said on Tuesday as they published a list of companies that manufacture and fund throwaway plastic.\r\n\r\nThe first â€œPlastic Waste Makers Indexâ€, published by the Australia-based philanthropic Minderoo Foundation, calculated that 20 companies - mainly energy and chemicals giants - are the source of half of the worldâ€™s single-use plastic waste.\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastics - such as face masks, medical equipment, shopping bags, coffee cups and cling film - are made from polymers, which use fossil fuels as a base material.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, 130 million metric tonnes of single-use plastics were thrown away around the world, with 35% burned, 31% buried in managed landfills and 19% dumped directly on land or into the ocean, said a report on the index.\r\n\r\nThe index used a range of data sources to track the flow of single-use plastic materials through their life cycle - from polymer form to finished goods to waste - and estimated where they were produced, converted, consumed and disposed of.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil topped the index of polymer producers generating single-use plastic waste, contributing 5.9 million tonnes in 2019, according to the report developed with energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie and researchers at think-tanks and universities.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil said in emailed comments it â€œshares societyâ€™s concern about plastic waste and agrees it must be addressedâ€, requiring a collaborative effort between business, governments, green groups and consumers.\r\n\r\nIt added that it was taking action to address plastic waste by increasing recyclability, backing efforts to recover more plastic waste and working on advanced recycling solutions that could help lower greenhouse gas emissions linked to products.\r\n\r\nThe report said nearly 60% of the commercial finance for the single-use plastic industry comes from 20 global banks that have loaned almost $30 billion for polymer production since 2011.\r\n\r\nIn a foreword, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said the climate and plastic waste crises are â€œincreasingly intertwinedâ€, with the atmosphere treated like an â€œopen sewerâ€ for planet-heating emissions and the ocean like a â€œliquid landfillâ€ for plastic waste.\r\n\r\nBut as the electricity and transport sectors transition to clean energy, the companies that extract and sell fossil fuels are â€œscrambling to massively expandâ€ their petrochemicals market, three-quarters of which is plastic production, he wrote.\r\n\r\nâ€œSince most plastic is made from oil and gas â€“ especially fracked gas â€“ the production and consumption of plastic are becoming a significant driver of the climate crisis, already producing greenhouse gas emissions on the same scale as a large country,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nAcademic estimates of the carbon footprint of plastics have indicated the whole life cycle of single-use plastics accounted for about 1.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019, with polymers the main contributor, the report authors said.\r\n\r\nOn their current growth path, single-use plastics could be responsible for 5-10% of annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 if the world meets the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, they added.\r\n\r\nThe Minderoo Foundation said petrochemicals companies should be required to disclose their â€œplastic waste footprintâ€ and commit to producing plastics from recycled plastic waste rather than fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nIt also called on banks and investors to shift their money away from companies that produce new fossil fuel-based virgin plastics to those that use recycled plastic feedstocks.\r\n\r\nSam Fankhauser, professor of climate change economics and policy at the University of Oxfordâ€™s Smith School and a contributor to the report, said making clear the roles different companies play in the plastics value chain was important because most pressure so far has centred on retailers.\r\n\r\nA plastic bag, for example, does not show the name of the petrochemicals firm that made its main ingredient but rather the supermarket whose goods it is designed to carry, he noted.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe just donâ€™t know enough about that chain - that allows people to hide behind it,â€ he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\r\n\r\nGreater transparency and disclosure by companies and banks of their involvement in producing or financing single-use plastics could encourage consumers and then shareholders to start pushing for action, as seen with climate change, he added.', 0);

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),
(51, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-oil-recycling-idUSKBN2EZ1EF', '2021-07-29 11:09:40', NULL, NULL, 'Total greenhouse gases (GHG) footprint across transport modes', 'Special Report-The Recycling Myth: Big Oilâ€™s solution for plastic waste littered with failure', 'BOISE, Idaho (Reuters) - In early 2018, residents of Boise, Idaho were told by city officials that a breakthrough technology could transform their hard-to-recycle plastic waste into low-polluting fuel. The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste.

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging.\r\n\r\nThe new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study.\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),
(56, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Waste reduction in direct operations, packaging and products', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0);

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),
(58, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Total Waste Recycled', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0);

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastic consumption has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO. Face masks and latex gloves are washing up daily on Asiaâ€™s remote beaches. Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging.\r\n\r\nThe new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study.\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),

(62, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Using recycled materials in the products', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0);

REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastic consumption has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO. Face masks and latex gloves are washing up daily on Asiaâ€™s remote beaches. Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging.\r\n\r\nThe new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study.\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

Woods, ExxonMobil chairman and chief executive officer, said at the companyâ€™s annual investor day at the New York Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nâ€œUsing the strength of our balance sheet to invest through the cycle is a key element of our strategy. We are taking advantage of a favorable cost environment and investing in advantaged projects â€“ underpinned by the long-term fundamentals of growing demand. The strength of our portfolio and our financial capacity enable us to continuously evaluate our priorities and the pace of investments while preserving value, which is critical in current market conditions and near decade-low commodity prices and margins.â€\r\n\r\nWoods told investors that ExxonMobil is planning capital expenditures of between $30 billion to $35 billion annually through 2025, consistent with previous guidance. For 2020, the company anticipates an investment level of up to $33 billion, depending on the progress of individual projects.\r\n\r\nWoods also outlined progress on key projects that support ExxonMobilâ€™s growth plans, including:\r\n\r\nIn Guyana, the estimated gross recoverable resource from the Stabroek Block increased to more than 8 billion oil-equivalent barrels, in part as a result of six additional discoveries made in 2019 and 2020. ExxonMobil and its partners started production of oil at the Liza field in December 2019, less than five years after the first discovery of hydrocarbons and years ahead of industry average. Production in Guyana is expected to reach more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2025.\r\n\r\nIn the Permian Basin, production volumes increased and remain on track to exceed 1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day by 2024. A capital-efficient development approach is being applied at scale, differentiating ExxonMobil from its competition. The process, known as cube development, accesses multiple shale layers simultaneously, saving money, maximizing value of resources and reducing surface footprint. The company emphasized it is evaluating the pace of near-term development activities in response to market conditions, and can do so while preserving value. Permian well cost and performance continues to improve and future growth will be supported by integrated infrastructure capacity expansions at the companyâ€™s Gulf Coast refineries and petrochemical operations.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil holds the leading acreage position in Brazil among international oil companies and added more than 450,000 acres in 2019, for a total of 2.5 million net acres. The company has plans to increase exploration activity in 2020 and 2021, and Phase 1 of the Bacalhau field development is progressing on schedule.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil reported strong performance from its low-cost liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations in Papua New Guinea, and the company continues to work with the governments in Papua New Guinea and Mozambique to advance new projects to support long-term demand growth.\r\n\r\nIn the downstream, ExxonMobil remains focused on maximizing value from its base assets through increased integration, utilization and efficiency. Project improvements continue to add value, and recent investments in Beaumont, Rotterdam and Antwerp generated earnings of $300 million in 2019.\r\n\r\nIn the chemical business, long-term global fundamentals continue to support the companyâ€™s expansion projects throughout the U.S. Gulf Coast and in Asia. Eight projects have been completed, four reached a final investment decision in 2019, and one additional project is being progressed. These investments are expected to deliver a 30 percent increase in sales growth relative to 2017.\r\n\r\nThe company is actively upgrading its portfolio through strategic divestments, and continues to progress its $15 billion divestment program.\r\n\r\nWoods said ExxonMobilâ€™s long-term growth plans are rooted in the companyâ€™s efforts to meet the worldâ€™s increasing demand for reliable and affordable energy, while reducing emissions and risks associated with climate change.\r\n\r\nPopulation growth and an expanding middle class will increase energy demand, which will require massive investments in oil and natural gas even in the more stringent low carbon scenarios, he said. Investments in new technologies to reduce emissions will also be needed.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil is a technology leader and is collaborating with world-leading research institutions to advance lower-emission solutions including biofuels, carbon capture and energy-efficient manufacturing. The company is targeting the critical sectors of commercial transportation, power generation and high-energy industrial processes, because they produce 80 percent of energy-related emissions and current technologies are insufficient to achieve deep reductions.\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil is committed to being part of the solution,â€ said Woods. â€œWeâ€™re investing in new energy supplies to improve global living standards, working on technologies that are needed to reduce emissions and supporting sensible policies, such as those putting a price on carbon or regulations to reduce emissions of methane.â€\r\n\r\nAbout ExxonMobil\r\n\r\nExxonMobil, one of the largest publicly traded international energy companies, uses technology and innovation to help meet the worldâ€™s growing energy needs.

REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastic consumption has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO. Face masks and latex gloves are washing up daily on Asiaâ€™s remote beaches. Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging.\r\n\r\nThe new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study.\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),
(72, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Total Waste Generated Globally', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),
(73, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-plastic-oil-recycling-idUSKBN2EZ1EF', '2021-07-29 11:09:40', NULL, NULL, 'Total Waste Generated Globally', 'Special Report-The Recycling Myth: Big Oilâ€™s solution for plastic waste littered with failure', 'BOISE, Idaho (Reuters) - In early 2018, residents of Boise, Idaho were told by city officials that a breakthrough technology could transform their hard-to-recycle plastic waste into low-polluting fuel. The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem.

In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

The reason the talks ended could not be learned.\r\n\r\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevronâ€™s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxonâ€™s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the companyâ€™s long-term profitability and spending decisions.\r\n\r\nIn their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.\r\n\r\nA proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last Novemberâ€™s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all.\r\n\r\nNow, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015./File Photo\r\n\r\nBiden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035.\r\n\r\nThe White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nNews of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction.\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxonâ€™s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.\r\n\r\nExxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED GIANT\r\n\r\nA combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil.\r\n\r\nDespite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United Statesâ€™ best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the worldâ€™s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said.\r\n\r\nLast yearâ€™s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output.\r\n\r\nU.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection.\r\n\r\nYet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s spread.\r\n\r\nAt one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982.', 0),

We are standing up for ourselves, standing up for our country, standing up for our region and standing up for the planet,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nGuyanaâ€™s ministry of natural resources and the attorney generalâ€™s office did not respond to emailed requests for comment. ExxonMobil did not return calls seeking comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nIn April, Mike Cousins, ExxonMobilâ€™s senior vice president of exploration and new ventures, said in a statement that making progress on the companyâ€™s plans in Guyana was â€œvitalâ€ to unlock value from offshore resources for the countryâ€™s people.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said last month the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\n\"There is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,\" he added.

Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,â€ he added.', 0);

They approached Mr McCoy, who agreed to speak over Zoom.\r\n\r\nDuring the covert recordings, which have been passed to Channel 4 News, Mr McCoy claims:\r\n\r\nthe company secretly fought against legislative action on climate change using third-party organisations\r\n\r\nhe lobbied key senators to remove and/or diminish climate change measures from President Bidenâ€™s US $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs bill as it proceeds through the legislative process\r\n\r\nhe regards trade bodies like the American Petroleum Institute as â€œwhipping boysâ€ in order to avoid public scrutiny on Capitol Hill\r\n\r\nDuring the virtual meeting held on 7 May, the investigators asked Mr McCoy questions about ExxonMobilâ€™s current and historical lobbying on environmental issues.\r\n\r\nIn the excerpts from the footage to be broadcast on Channel 4 News tonight, Mr McCoy claims that ExxonMobil has aggressively fought science to deny climate change in order to maximise profit and shareholder return. He alleges that ExxonMobil joined â€œshadow groupsâ€ to pursue climate change denial.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy said: â€œDid we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, thatâ€™s true. But thereâ€™s nothing, thereâ€™s nothing illegal about that.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe were looking out for our investments. We were looking out for our shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nExxonMobil told Channel 4 News that they â€œhave supported climate science for decades.â€\r\n\r\nâ€˜Itâ€™s like fishingâ€™\r\n\r\nMr McCoy likens the approach to lobbying congressmen to the way fishermen target fish, claiming that ExxonMobil puts out â€œbaitâ€ and then â€œreels inâ€ congressmen on issues like carbon tax, electric vehicles, chemicals, taxation and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy said: â€œWhen you have an opportunity to talk to a member of Congress, I liken it to fishing, right? You know you have bait, you throw that bait out. And they say: â€˜Oh, you want to talk about infrastructure, yeah.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd then you start to reel them in and you start to have these conversations about federal leasing programmes, you start to have these conversations about a carbon tax. You know, itâ€™s all these opportunities that you use and to use the fishing analogy again just to kind of reel them in.â€\r\n\r\nHe added: â€œI make sure I get them the right information that they need so they look good. And then they help me out. Theyâ€™re a captive audience. They know they need you. And I need them.â€\r\n\r\nHe says lobbyists aim to have a direct relationship with a member of congress, adding: â€œYou want to be able to go to the chiefâ€¦ and say we need congressman so and so to be able to either introduce this bill, we need him to make a floor statement, we need him to send a letter. You name it, weâ€™ve asked for everything.â€\r\n\r\nâ€˜The Kingmakerâ€™\r\n\r\nMr McCoy names 11 senators who he says are â€œcrucialâ€ to ExxonMobil: Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Senator Joe Manchin, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Senator Jon Tester, Senator Maggie Hassan, Senator John Barrasso, Senator John Cornyn, Senator Steve Daines, Senator Chris Coons, Senator Mark Kelly and Senator Marco Rubio\r\n\r\nWe gave all these senators a chance to respond. All the senators declined to comment. There is no suggestion of illegality.\r\n\r\nChannel 4 News has established, through Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, that all except two of these senators (Senators Maggie Hassan and Mark Kelly) have received financial contributions from ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil insists â€œour lobbying efforts fully comply with all laws and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basisâ€.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy described Senator Joe Manchin as â€œthe Kingmakerâ€ in the Senate and he says he spoke to his office on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nThe FEC data shows Senator Manchin has received at least $12,500 from the ExxonMobil Political Action Committee in declared disbursements since the beginning of the 2011-12 election cycle.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy described how a â€œbig piece of [his] job is education and advocacyâ€ and says that in his work on behalf of ExxonMobil he argues that US government programmes to roll out electric vehicles are unrealistic.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œThe research and development conversation has taken us a long way because of climate change. And there is a struggle to find solutions and to get the reductions that theyâ€™re looking for. And youâ€™re not going to be able to just switch to battery operated vehicles or wind for your electricity. And just having that conversation around why thatâ€™s not possible in the next 10 years is critically important to the work that we do.â€\r\n\r\nâ€˜Whipping boyâ€™\r\n\r\nMr McCoy described a lobbying strategy in which he claims ExxonMobil uses third parties to mask its interests from public view and accountability.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œWe donâ€™t want it to be us, to have these conversations, especially in a hearing. Itâ€™s getting our associations to step in and have those conversations and answer those tough questions and be for, the lack of a better term, the whipping boy for some of these members of congress.â€\r\n\r\nHe added: â€œThere was something we were working on earlier this week where we, where our CEO was invited to a hearing from a member of congress who we know is just going to rip him to shreds when he goes there. So, we look at it and we say: well, why us?â€\r\n\r\nMr McCoy claims that ExxonMobil lobbied Congress to dilute the climate provisions of President Bidenâ€™s Infrastructure Bill.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œThatâ€™s a completely different conversation when you start to stick to roads and bridges. And instead of a $2 trillion bill, itâ€™s an $800 billion dollar bill. If you lower that threshold, you stick to highways and bridges then a lot of the negative stuff starts to come out.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhy would you put in something on emissions reductions on climate change to oil refineries in a highway bill? So, people say yeah that doesnâ€™t make any sense, so then you get to the germane of saying that shouldnâ€™t be in this bill.â€\r\n\r\nExxonMobil said: â€œOur discussion on the bill are not accurately portrayed. Our lobbying efforts are related to a tax burden that could disadvantage us businesses.â€\r\n\r\nCarbon tax\r\n\r\nMr McCoy appears to suggest that ExxonMobilâ€™s public support for a carbon tax is underpinned by the conviction it will never happen, allowing the company to â€œsupportâ€ it in order to appear green.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œI will tell you there is not an appetite for a carbon tax. It is a non-starter. Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. And the cynical side of me says yeah we kind of know that. But it gives us a talking point. We can say well what is ExxonMobil for? Well weâ€™re for a carbon tax.\r\n\r\nâ€œCarbon tax is not gonna happen. I have always said, and Iâ€™ve worked on climate change issues for twenty years. Thereâ€™s a lot of talk around it and the bottom line is itâ€™s going to take political courage, political will in order to get something done. And that just doesnâ€™t exist in politics. It just doesnâ€™t.\r\n\r\nPurporting to speak on behalf of ExxonMobil, Mr McCoy also expressed a corporate view that, contrary to science, natural gas is a clean energy source.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œOn a clean electricity standard, we think natural gas will play a key role in anything. And not just as a bridge fuel. We think it is a low emission energy source and should be part of a clean electricity standard.â€\r\n\r\nExxonMobil statement\r\n\r\nA spokesperson for ExxonMobil told Channel 4 News: â€œGreenpeace has waged a multi-decade campaign against our company and industry, which has included false claims and unlawful actions at our facilities as well as those of other companies around the world.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur lobbying efforts are related to a tax burden that could disadvantage U.S. businesses, and we have made that position known publicly. ExxonMobil stands by our position that increased taxes on American businesses make the U.S. less competitive.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have been clear in supporting an efficient, economy-wide price on carbon as the best way to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. While there is not broad support for a tax, we are actively and publicly discussing other options, including lower-carbon fuels and other sector-based approaches that would place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have supported climate science for decades. Greenpeace and others have distorted our position on climate science and our support for effective policy solutions.\r\n\r\nâ€ExxonMobil transparently engages with a variety of trade associations, think tanks and coalitions in order to promote informed dialogue and sound public policy in areas pertinent to the Corporationâ€™s interests.\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil exercises its right to engage in lobbying in the United States at both the Federal and State levels to advocate our positions on issues that affect our Corporation and the energy industry.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have a responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to represent their interests in public policy discussions that impact our business.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur lobbying efforts fully comply with all laws and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis, including the issues we discuss.â€', 0),

Alexander Karsner, a strategist at Google owner Alphabet Inc, won the fundâ€™s third seat out of its 12-member board. Engine No. 1 nominated four candidates, but the fourth was not elected.\r\n\r\nUS oil giants ExxonMobil and Chevron yesterday suffered shareholder backlash from activists and institutional investors over their failure to set viable emissions reduction strategies. The New York Times writes that â€œanalysts could not recall another time that Exxon management had lost a vote against company-picked directors.â€\r\n\r\nHedge fund activists Engine No. 1 successfully replaced two Exxon board members with its own candidates, and a vote on a third, Alexander Karsner, a senior strategist at X, is â€œnot yet determined.â€\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1 â€œholds a stake worth just $54 million in a company with $248 billion in market capitalization. Exxonâ€™s shares rose 0.7% to $58.64 after the votes were tallied Wednesday,â€ reports the Financial Times.\r\n\r\nBlackRock, the worldâ€™s biggest asset manager and Exxonâ€™s second largest shareholder with a 6.7% stake, backed Engine No. 1â€™s campaign. So did Legal & General Investment Management, which owns investment shares worth nearly $1 billion and is a top 20 Exxon shareholder.\r\n\r\nChris James, founder of Engine No. 1, said in an interview [via the NYT]:\r\n\r\nThis isnâ€™t really about ideology, itâ€™s about economics. And economics is what has driven the adoption of some of the alternative fuel sources versus fossil fuels. We want there to be an acceptance of change.\r\n\r\nSo what can two or three board members achieve out of a total of 12? Their presence strengthens the position of investment firms pushing for climate change. Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp writes:\r\n\r\nIt is about major asset managers and other influential investors stepping up, making their voices heard and walking the walk, connecting the dots between their climate rhetoric and their actions.\r\n\r\nOver at Chevron, a majority of shareholders voted 61% in favor of a proposal from Dutch campaign group Follow This to force the oil giant to cut its scope 3 emissions â€“ the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organization, but that the organization indirectly impacts in its value chain.\r\n\r\nMark van Baal, cofounder of Follow This, said:\r\n\r\nInstitutional investors understand that no investment is safe in a global economy wracked by devastating climate change.\r\n\r\nUS electric power report\r\n\r\nAccording to new data in the US Energy Information Administrationâ€™s â€œElectric Power Monthlyâ€ report, net generation of solar and wind power in the US increased by 24.3% (31,357 MWh) and 10.5% (96,658 MWh), respectively, in total electric power year-to-date, for January to March 2021 and 2020.\r\n\r\nOverall, renewable sources excluding hydroelectric were up 10.8% (136,262 MWh). That includes wind, solar, wood, other biomass, and geothermal. Hydroelectric conventional was down by 7.5% (69,646 MWh) and hydroelectric pumped storage was up 11.1% (-1,085 MWh).\r\n\r\nOn the fossil fuel front, coal was up 34.8% (231,675 MWh) and natural gas was down 10.8% (342,372 MWh). This was due to higher prices for natural gas as a result of growth in liquefied natural gas exports and rising domestic natural gas consumption.\r\n\r\nFurther, in March, S&P Global Platts reported:\r\n\r\nThe EIA said the â€˜recent extreme cold weather in much of the country contributed to an increase in coal use for power generation,â€ but added that the â€œsupply for rising coal-fired generation will be partly met by draws from on-site stockpiles at power plants.â€™\r\n\r\nGoing forward, renewables are projected to make up 21.2% of US power generation in 2021 and 22.6% in 2022, up from 19.7% in 2020. Coal is expected to make up 22.6% of power generation in 2021 and 22.8% in 2022, up from 19.9% generated in 2020. Power generation from natural gas is estimated at 35.8% in 2021 and 34.9% in 2022, compared with 39.2% in 2020.\r\n\r\nGlobally, coal is expected to flatten by 2025 and renewables will surpass the fossil fuel, according to the International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

The well was drilled in 1,725 meters of water and is located approximately 11 kilometers south of the Uaru-1 well.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Uaru-2 discovery enhances our work to optimally sequence development opportunities in the Stabroek Block,â€ said Mike Cousins, senior vice president of exploration and new ventures at ExxonMobil. â€œProgressing our industry-leading investments and well-executed exploration plans are vital in order to continue to develop Guyanaâ€™s offshore resources that unlock additional value for the people of Guyana and all stakeholders.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Uaru-2 discovery will add to the discovered recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent,â€ said John Hess, CEO of Hess Corporation, a partner in the Stabroek Block. â€œWe expect to have at least six FPSOs on the Stabroek Block by 2027, with the potential for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base.â€\r\n\r\nIn January 2020, ExxonMobil announced that Uaru-1 was the 16th discovery in the prolific 26,800-square-kilometer Stabroek Block. The well encountered approximately 29 meters of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled in 1,933 meters of water.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021, ExxonMobil secured a sixth drillship, the Noble Sam Croft, for exploration and evaluation drilling activities offshore Guyana. A fourth project, Yellowtail, has been identified within the block with anticipated start up in late 2025 pending government approvals and project sanctioning. This project will develop the Yellowtail and Redtail fields, which are located about 30 kilometers southeast of the Liza developments.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil and its partners anticipate at least six projects online by 2027 and sees potential for up to 10 floating production, storage and offloading units (FPSO) to develop its current recoverable resource balance.\r\n\r\nProduction from the Liza Phase 1 development on the Stabroek Block utilizing the Liza Destiny FPSO reached its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day in December 2020 and remained at this level during the first quarter of 2021.\r\n\r\nIn mid April, production from the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in the flash gas compressor discharge silencer. Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000-110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately three months. Following this repair, production is expected to return to, or above, nameplate capacity.\r\n\r\nStartup of Liza Phase 2 remains on track for early 2022 utilizing the Liza Unity FPSO with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Unity FPSO prepares for sail away from Singapore to Guyana later this year.\r\n\r\nA third development at the Payara Field was sanctioned in September 2020 that will utilize the Prosperity FPSO with production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day; first oil is expected in 2024. The hull for the Prosperity FPSO is complete, and topsides construction activities have commenced in Singapore.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil affiliate Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited is operator and holds 45% interest in the Stabroek Block.

(90, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.lr.org', 'https://www.lr.org/en/insights/articles/evolving-world-of-inspection-technology/', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', NULL, NULL, 'Digitizing water Data (using technology to increase awareness of water issues & optimise water replenishment)', 'The evolving world of inspection technology.', 'So, what about Class?\r\n\r\nIn line with LRâ€™s key role in the offshore world â€“ ensuring floating assets are fit for purpose from construction, in-service to decommissioning â€“ LR worked with EM&I to provide a basis of â€˜what good looks likeâ€™ for the NoMan camera, outlining what needs to be inspected and at what level of detail, as the cameraâ€™s results directly feeds into the RBI plan agreed for that specific facility.\r\n\r\nProviding a greater level of insight and data about the tank, the NoMan camera can also improve LRâ€™s and the operatorâ€™s understanding of that specific facility, enabling better decisions around planned maintenance, by looking at specific areas rather than the entire asset, and if appropriate extend the life of an asset when it comes to redeployment.\r\n\r\nA collaborative approach\r\n\r\nLR is also part of HITS joint industry project (JIP) which is an international initiative that aims to improve the way the industry manages the integrity of marine structures such as FPSOs, FSRUs, FLNGs and other floating offshore assets. The JIP is now in its seventh phase which looks to stop human entry for tank inspections, through technologies such as the NoMan camera. Founded by EM&I in 2011, HITS is supported by operators, regulators, classification societies as well as service providers and has successfully delivered industry innovations and guidance related to improving hull inspection, enabling shared knowledge throughout the industry and awareness around key issues.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nThroughout the inspection, a surveyor located outside of the tank instructs the EM&I camera operator of the specific areas that need to be inspected. Referring to the agreed RBI plan for that facility, the surveyor can identify areas they suspect to be corroded or cracked, for example. If this is not the case, it could postpone maintenance. Alternatively, if more corrosion is found, surveyors and crew can expediate repairs and maintenance, enabling the operator to make robust decisions and plan effective maintenance, all of which having limited impact on operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis leads to a very focused inspection, rather than inspecting the whole tank, the traditional way, making the process more efficient â€“ saving time and money for the operator,â€ said Constantinis.\r\n\r\nBy using the NoMan camera, surveyors and crew can take stills that capture the exact time, date and location within the tank, providing realistic depictions that can be used for comparison at a future inspection by a different LR surveyor and inform decision-making by the operator at a later stage if repairs are needed.\r\n\r\nâ€œOngoing developments of NoMan include specialised laser scanning cameras which will provide additional information on structural conditionâ€ added Constantinis.\r\n\r\nNext steps\r\n\r\nCurrently, the NoMan camera can provide surveyors with a clear view of the inside of the tank but it cannot measure thickness or the distortion of components â€“ so determining how thick a metal plate is or whether itâ€™s getting thinner or is starting to bend cannot be performed by NoMan.\r\n\r\nEM&I are now developing synchronous laser scanning technology for the NoMan camera system which can scan the tank and provide distortion information and thickness readings. This dimensional information can then be used by surveyors to understand the state of the tank, identify corrosion or other damage and determine which materials/areas/equipment need to be replaced. Importantly, by providing realistic data, the NoMan camera can help surveyors and operators understand the structural integrity of the facility, by feeding into the assetâ€™s RBI plan, making planned maintenance more efficient.\r\n\r\nFrom a class perspective, LR will provide guidance to EM&I on what areas of the tank need to be inspected using the synchronous laser scanning technology and the correct data needed by surveyors to determine if thereâ€™s any corrosion or damage. This is in alignment with LRâ€™s guide, â€œRemote Inspection Technique Systems (RITS) Assessment Standard for use on LR Class Surveys of Steel Structureâ€, which sets out LRâ€™s expectations on what RITS such as the synchronous laser scanning technology should achieve. If approved, operators will see through LRâ€™s third-party validation that the technology is doing what itâ€™s supposed to do, and regulators can see that LR and EM&I continue to work in line with best practice, industry standards and latest guidance associated with hull integrity and tank inspection.\r\n\r\nFrom a regulatory perspective, LR continues to work with regulators to ensure they have confidence in the latest inspection technologies, which are in line with LRâ€™s RITS Assessment Standard and consequently, the offshore industry makes progressive steps to ensure assets are verified as safe while where possible also remove personnel from hazardous environments.\r\n\r\nBy utilising data from technology such as the NoMan camera and synchronous laser scanning, class societies, inspection companies and operators should reach a point where all parties involved can see patterns over time, significant structural issues with the design, for example, and actually determine what the change means rather than see change simply occurring.\r\n\r\nAs to the future, Constantinis is optimistic about the NoMan camera system. â€œEM&Iâ€™s ambition going forward is to develop software or some sort artificial intelligence which will recognise and eventually predict patterns over time, such as coating damage, instead of reviewing hours and hours of video.â€\r\n\r\nGoing forward, this data will support the offshore industryâ€™s eventual move to artificial intelligence and digital twins, informing key decision-making with regards to potential redeployment opportunities and life extension.', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

ExxonMobil did not return calls seeking comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nIn April, Mike Cousins, ExxonMobilâ€™s senior vice president of exploration and new ventures, said in a statement that making progress on the companyâ€™s plans in Guyana was â€œvitalâ€ to unlock value from offshore resources for the countryâ€™s people.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said last month the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\n\"There is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,\" he added.

U.S. fossil fuel giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have been unwavering about their commitment to drilling for black gold: As long as people are buying, theyâ€™re selling. With oil prices above $80 a barrel, the companiesâ€™ respective chiefs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth arenâ€™t in a bad place.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the $272 billion Exxon said that revenue jumped 60% in the three quarters ended in September compared with the same period last year, to $74 billion. Chevronâ€™s sales rose 83% over the same period. Production and capital expenditures didnâ€™t waver much at either company. Exxon said in prepared remarks that if commodity prices stay where they are, it expects earnings to double from 2019 levels by 2025.\r\n\r\nA swerve from European giants away from dirtier kinds of fuel has helped prices. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) are selling some fossil-fuel businesses. But the use of oil and gas, after being hit by the pandemic, has come roaring back just as the market became starved for investment. The number of rigs dropped by 40% since the end of 2019, according to Baker Hughes. Shell is now battling activist investor Dan Loeb, who wants it to split after making huge commitments to spending on renewable power.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nWoods and Wirth have stayed firm in their strategies over the past 18 months. Though Exxon instated new directors on its board that are focused on climate initiatives, theyâ€™ve forged ahead with discoveries in long-dated offshore drilling locations like Guyana. Last year, Chevron scooped up Noble Energy when the price of Brent crude was about half what it sells for today.\r\n\r\nThe gap between investment in fossil fuels and renewable energy is narrowing as capital expenditures in oil and gas fall, according to Rystad Energy. Meantime Exxonâ€™s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 is a fifth lower than at the start of the pandemic. It leaves the two U.S.-based drillers, and select giants elsewhere like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), in a mini sweet spot. It also challenges the idea â€“ at least for now â€“ that green investment neednâ€™t be an act of altruism.\r\n\r\nFollow @thereallsl on Twitter\r\n\r\nCONTEXT NEWS\r\n\r\n- Chevron said on Oct. 29 that third quarter total revenue including from affiliates was $45 billion, an 83% jump compared with the same period the previous year as the oil giantâ€™s total production rose 7%.\r\n\r\n- The same day, Exxon Mobil said its sales of $74 billion increased 60% year-on-year, as it pumped slightly less oil and other fossil fuels than during the same quarter a year earlier.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nEditing by John Foley and Amanda Gomez\r\n\r\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\r\n\r\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Capital spending for this year would be reduced to $1.2 billion and exploration spending to $400 million, while in 2021-2022 it expects capital spending to be â€œwell belowâ€ $1 billion. The company said its ambition to continue paying dividends â€œremained firmâ€, but the board still had to assess the situation.\r\n\r\nBPBP Plc said it planned to reduce capital and operational spending, which was about $15 billion last year.\r\n\r\nCHEVRON\r\n\r\nChevron Corp said it aimed to trim spending and lower oil output in the near term. The oil majorâ€™s 2020 organic capital expenditure guidance had been $20 billion.\r\n\r\nDNO\r\n\r\nNorwayâ€™s DNO, which operates in Iraqâ€™s Kurdistan region, said it would cut its 2020 budget by 30% or $300 million and lower its dividend for the first half of the year.\r\n\r\nENERGEAN\r\n\r\nMediterranean gas group Energean said it would cut its investments by $155 million in Greece and Israel and could reduce its budget for Egypt by another $140 million if needed without endangering delivery of its long-term offtake deals.\r\n\r\nENI\r\n\r\nEni followed rivals by cancelling a share buyback and sharply cutting investments.

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

U.S. fossil fuel giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have been unwavering about their commitment to drilling for black gold: As long as people are buying, theyâ€™re selling. With oil prices above $80 a barrel, the companiesâ€™ respective chiefs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth arenâ€™t in a bad place.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the $272 billion Exxon said that revenue jumped 60% in the three quarters ended in September compared with the same period last year, to $74 billion. Chevronâ€™s sales rose 83% over the same period. Production and capital expenditures didnâ€™t waver much at either company. Exxon said in prepared remarks that if commodity prices stay where they are, it expects earnings to double from 2019 levels by 2025.\r\n\r\nA swerve from European giants away from dirtier kinds of fuel has helped prices. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) are selling some fossil-fuel businesses. But the use of oil and gas, after being hit by the pandemic, has come roaring back just as the market became starved for investment. The number of rigs dropped by 40% since the end of 2019, according to Baker Hughes.

Though Exxon instated new directors on its board that are focused on climate initiatives, theyâ€™ve forged ahead with discoveries in long-dated offshore drilling locations like Guyana. Last year, Chevron scooped up Noble Energy when the price of Brent crude was about half what it sells for today.\r\n\r\nThe gap between investment in fossil fuels and renewable energy is narrowing as capital expenditures in oil and gas fall, according to Rystad Energy.

The reason the talks ended could not be learned.\r\n\r\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevronâ€™s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxonâ€™s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the companyâ€™s long-term profitability and spending decisions.\r\n\r\nIn their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.\r\n\r\nA proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last Novemberâ€™s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all.\r\n\r\nNow, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015./File Photo\r\n\r\nBiden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline.

Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.\r\n\r\nExxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED GIANT\r\n\r\nA combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil.\r\n\r\nDespite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United Statesâ€™ best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the worldâ€™s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said.\r\n\r\nLast yearâ€™s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output.\r\n\r\nU.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection.\r\n\r\nYet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s spread.\r\n\r\nAt one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year.

Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Reuters Professional has an agreement with Signal to publish stories based on these datasets.\r\n\r\n<<', 0),

In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

(122, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Fleet fuel consumed', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

REUTERS/Stringer\r\n\r\nState-run Qatar Petroleum (QP) declined to comment on the reported delay, which comes as the global gas industry faces the major challenge of a supply glut due to booming U.S. production and a drop in Chinese demand.\r\n\r\nQatar, the lowest cost producer of LNG, sits on the worldâ€™s largest gas field and offers terms that led oil majors ExxonMobil XOM.N and Royal Dutch/Shell RDSa.L to invest tens of billions of dollars in the past.\r\n\r\nThe big energy firms have waited a decade for a new opportunity to invest in Qatar after the country put further development on hold to ensure the giant North Field could sustain production.\r\n\r\nThe moratorium was lifted two years ago and QP shortlisted six Western majors for the next phase of expansion. QP didnâ€™t disclose the names but said it would announce partners in the first quarter of 2020.\r\n\r\nBut late last year QP said it had decided to expand LNG production by 60% to 126 million tonnes a year by 2027 instead of the original plan for a 40% increase.

I think the decision should be ready by the end of 2020,â€ one of the sources involved in talks said.\r\n\r\nThree other sources familiar with the talks confirmed a delay to at least the middle of 2020 because the scaling up of the expansion combined with a much lower gas price outlook were affecting every aspect of potential partnerships.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe conversation is centered on the valuation of the project which affects equity and financing,â€ said one source.\r\n\r\nâ€œQatarâ€™s cost base is very low compared to other projects but in todayâ€™s environment, every project has to compete for capital,â€ said another source.\r\n\r\nQatar, which has a wealth fund in excess of $320 billion, has said it would build the facilities alone if necessary, but would prefer to have partners to share risks and costs as well as give access to new customers.\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH GAS\r\n\r\nGlobal LNG prices collapsed to an all-time low in Asia in January as China reduced energy consumption because of the spread of coronavirus. Lower demand from China undermined hopes that the biggest user of the fuel would soak up excess supply to reduce its dependence on coal.\r\n\r\nThe United States is rapidly increasing LNG export capacity to drain a large domestic surplus.\r\n\r\nGas prices have been so low for so long in the United States that many shale-gas firms have struggled to raise debt and pioneers such as Chesapeake Energy are battling to stave off bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nU.S. gas producers had hoped that exports would raise the value of their fuel, but instead they are contributing to a supply glut is pushing down prices worldwide.\r\n\r\nQP did not say how much it would cost to build six more LNG trains and develop offshore production facilities.\r\n\r\nOne standard LNG train with capacity of 8 million tonnes a year costs around $10 billion, meaning QP would need to spend at least $60 billion on the expansion.\r\n\r\nExxon, Shell, Total TOTF.PA and ConocoPhillips COP.N have been partners in Qatarâ€™s existing LNG plants since the country began its journey toward becoming a top player only 20 years ago.\r\n\r\nSome of these firms have signed deals over the past year giving Qatar stakes in their oil and gas projects.\r\n\r\nBut the lower outlook for natural gas prices led energy majors to lower their projections for the rate of return on Qatarâ€™s expansion phase, making it less lucrative than previously expected, according to the three sources involved in the talks.\r\n\r\nA slew of LNG projects around the world from Canada to Mozambique and Nigeria is expected to lead to an even bigger oversupply later this decade.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople began to worry where all this gas is going to go,â€ one of the three sources said.', 0);

Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,â€ he added.', 0),

We have a lot of potential outside of federal land, too,â€ Chief Operating Officer Billy Helms said during an investor conference last year.\r\n\r\nOccidental said last year it had well over 200 federal drilling permits in hand and had requested another roughly 200 permits on New Mexico acreage, where some of the richest reserves lie beneath federally owned property.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\r\n\r\nAmeredev II, which produces about 10,000 barrels of oil per day in New Mexicoâ€™s Permian, also has federal drilling permits to last at least four years.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re trying to maximize our value against an uncertain range of possibilities,â€ said CEO Parker Reese.\r\n\r\nEnergy consultancy Rystad said it saw stockpiling of federal lands drilling permits in the run-up to the November presidential election, with federal permit requests rising to a 31% share of all permit requests in the major U.S. oilfields from 18% in 2019.\r\n\r\nBidenâ€™s team did not respond to several requests for comment.\r\n\r\nMost onshore federal drilling happens in Western states like New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming, which get a share of extraction royalties and depend on that revenue.\r\n\r\nAs Biden takes office, U.S. shale drilling industry has already declined sharply due to weak prices.\r\n\r\nTotal U.S. shale output is expected to fall to 7.5 million barrels per day in February, the U.S. Energy Department said on Tuesday, which would be the lowest since June 2020.\r\n\r\nShale drilling accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. crude oil production, but output is expected to decline throughout 2021 as producers rein in spending.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EXISTENTIAL THREATâ€™\r\n\r\nA large swathe of the industry is made up of smaller firms that lack the deep pockets to squirrel away permits, get a jumpstart on installing new emissions control technologies or take their business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe impact on the independent oilman is a heck of a lot greater than it is on Big Oil,â€ said Don Law, owner of Denver-based Prima Exploration Inc, which produces about half of its 1,000 barrels of oil a day on federal lands, mainly in Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota.\r\n\r\nLaw called Bidenâ€™s promised policy â€œan existential threatâ€ unlike any he has encountered in 40 years in the oil business, echoing the rhetoric used by some climate activists about the threat posed by global warming.\r\n\r\nMany smaller drilling firms operate in a single state or basin, according to trade group Western Energy Alliance, and would struggle to pack up and leave.\r\n\r\nâ€œI actually live here,â€ said Mark Murphy, a third-generation oilman in New Mexico. His company, Strata Production Co, has 15 employees and operates 47 wells, mostly on federal acreage.\r\n\r\nWestern Energy Alliance, the oil and gas industry trade group most focused on public lands policy, has pledged to fight any efforts to impose a leasing ban in court. States that rely heavily on revenues from federal oil and gas drilling are also ramping up opposition.\r\n\r\nLast month Wyoming officials issued a study that said a ban would cost eight Western states $8.1 billion in tax revenue and $34.1 billion in investment in the next five years. The stateâ€™s governor, Mark Gordon, called the predictions â€œdevastating.â€\r\n\r\nNew Mexicoâ€™s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said in late 2019 that she would seek a waiver from any drilling ban imposed by a future administration. But she has not discussed the issue publicly since, and her office did not respond to several requests for comment.', 0),

The reason the talks ended could not be learned.\r\n\r\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevronâ€™s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxonâ€™s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the companyâ€™s long-term profitability and spending decisions.\r\n\r\nIn their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.\r\n\r\nA proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last Novemberâ€™s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all.\r\n\r\nNow, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015./File Photo\r\n\r\nBiden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035.\r\n\r\nThe White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nNews of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction.\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxonâ€™s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.\r\n\r\nExxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED GIANT\r\n\r\nA combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil.\r\n\r\nDespite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United Statesâ€™ best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the worldâ€™s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said.\r\n\r\nLast yearâ€™s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output.\r\n\r\nU.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection.\r\n\r\nYet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s spread.\r\n\r\nAt one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982.', 0),

They do not reflect the views of Reuters News, which, under the Trust Principles, is committed to integrity, independence, and freedom from bias. Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Reuters Professional has an agreement with Signal to publish stories based on these datasets.\r\n\r\n<<', 0),

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi/File Photo/File Photo\r\n\r\nExxon has fended off attempts in the past to get it to change its policies and leadership, but pressure has mounted since the top U.S. oil producer posted a historic annual loss for 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic slashed energy demand.\r\n\r\nThe company responded by reducing the value of its shale gas properties by more than $20 billion, cutting spending on new projects by nearly a third, laying off workers and adding $21 billion to its debt to cover spending.\r\n\r\nUbben founded activist investment firm ValueAct and now runs social impact investment firm Inclusive Capital, while Angelakis had served as Comcastâ€™s chief financial officer and now runs strategic investment company Atairos.\r\n\r\nExxon said their appointments increased the size of its board to 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. Earlier this year, Exxon named Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, a former chief executive officer of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, to the board.\r\n\r\nExxon said in a statement that Ubben and Angelakis would help the company as it â€œadvances plans to increase shareholder value by responsibly providing needed energy while playing a leadership role in the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nExxon, which was once Americaâ€™s most valuable company but now has a market value of only $240.6 billion, has faced fresh pressure from investors since late last year. The company is scheduled to hold its annual Investor Day this week.\r\n\r\nWhile running ValueAct, Ubben had long been viewed as a collaborative director who would work behind the scenes instead of publicly calling for the CEO to be fired.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, he has served as a director at energy company AES - he resigned on Monday because he was joining the Exxon board - where he helped the once coal-heavy power generator transition more to renewable energy. AESâ€™ share price more than doubled during his time on the board between early 2018 and now.\r\n\r\nIndustry analysts generally welcomed the board appointments, but some criticized them for not going far enough.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt remains to be seen how receptive Exxonâ€™s management will be to this pressure,â€ said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James, adding that â€œnot all board members share Ubbenâ€™s focus.â€\r\n\r\nThe move â€œlooks like a missed opportunity,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. â€œWhile the two candidates are impressive on their own, their appointments donâ€™t do anything to fill the gaps in experience on the Exxon board that have so concerned investors.â€\r\n\r\nFOCUS ON EMISSIONS\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a newly formed activist firm, publicly said it is trying to place four new directors on Exxonâ€™s board and prominent hedge fund D.E. Shaw said it is working behind the scenes to force change at the company. While best known as a fund that focuses on quantitative analysis, D.E. Shaw has pushed for change at Loweâ€™s Cos and Emerson Electric. Engine No. 1â€™s Charlie Penner was involved in many activist campaigns at Jana Partners.\r\n\r\nThe California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund is backing Engine No. 1, and other investors formed a coalition to push Exxon into making more sweeping changes.\r\n\r\nIn the face of that pressure, which some shareholders say will continue even as the new board members begin to advise the company on how it spends its money and focusing more on renewable energy, Exxon has cut its spending plans and disclosed updated emissions targets.\r\n\r\nD.E. Shaw said it welcomed the steps Exxon had taken in identifying cost savings and adding Ubben and Angelakis to the board, saying they will bring â€œsignificant capital markets and capital allocation experience to the boardroom and will provide meaningful value to the Company.â€\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1 said: â€œWe remain confident our nominees bring the right experience and skills to help put ExxonMobil on a path to sustainable, long-term value creation for the benefit of all shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nExxonâ€™s shares, which have lagged those of its closest rival Chevron Corp by a wide margin in the last five years, jumped 4.9% in trading to $57.02. The shares are up about 40% so far this year.\r\n\r\nSince December, Exxon has said it would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nIt also announced plans to commercialize technology that helps reduce carbon emissions and disclosed its Scope 3 emissions, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.', 0);

(132, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Investment Fund for renewable energy in the supply chain', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),
(133, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Investments in reducing our energy usage at the site level and implementing site-based green energy solutions is helping us to achieve significant cost savings through operational efficiencie', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population.

U.S. fossil fuel giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have been unwavering about their commitment to drilling for black gold: As long as people are buying, theyâ€™re selling. With oil prices above $80 a barrel, the companiesâ€™ respective chiefs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth arenâ€™t in a bad place.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the $272 billion Exxon said that revenue jumped 60% in the three quarters ended in September compared with the same period last year, to $74 billion. Chevronâ€™s sales rose 83% over the same period. Production and capital expenditures didnâ€™t waver much at either company. Exxon said in prepared remarks that if commodity prices stay where they are, it expects earnings to double from 2019 levels by 2025.\r\n\r\nA swerve from European giants away from dirtier kinds of fuel has helped prices. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) are selling some fossil-fuel businesses. But the use of oil and gas, after being hit by the pandemic, has come roaring back just as the market became starved for investment. The number of rigs dropped by 40% since the end of 2019, according to Baker Hughes. Shell is now battling activist investor Dan Loeb, who wants it to split after making huge commitments to spending on renewable power.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nWoods and Wirth have stayed firm in their strategies over the past 18 months. Though Exxon instated new directors on its board that are focused on climate initiatives, theyâ€™ve forged ahead with discoveries in long-dated offshore drilling locations like Guyana. Last year, Chevron scooped up Noble Energy when the price of Brent crude was about half what it sells for today.\r\n\r\nThe gap between investment in fossil fuels and renewable energy is narrowing as capital expenditures in oil and gas fall, according to Rystad Energy. Meantime Exxonâ€™s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 is a fifth lower than at the start of the pandemic. It leaves the two U.S.-based drillers, and select giants elsewhere like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), in a mini sweet spot. It also challenges the idea â€“ at least for now â€“ that green investment neednâ€™t be an act of altruism.\r\n\r\nFollow @thereallsl on Twitter\r\n\r\nCONTEXT NEWS\r\n\r\n- Chevron said on Oct. 29 that third quarter total revenue including from affiliates was $45 billion, an 83% jump compared with the same period the previous year as the oil giantâ€™s total production rose 7%.\r\n\r\n- The same day, Exxon Mobil said its sales of $74 billion increased 60% year-on-year, as it pumped slightly less oil and other fossil fuels than during the same quarter a year earlier.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nEditing by John Foley and Amanda Gomez\r\n\r\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\r\n\r\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Reuters Professional has an agreement with Signal to publish stories based on these datasets.\r\n\r\n<<', 0),

REUTERS/Lee Celano/File Photo\r\n\r\nExxon and other oil producers have been slashing costs due to a collapse in oil demand and ill-timed bets on new projects. The top U.S. oil company earlier outlined more than $10 billion in budget cuts this year. [nL1N2HK2P2]\r\n\r\nâ€œThe impact of COVID-19 on the demand for Exxon Mobilâ€™s products has increased the urgency of the ongoing efficiency work,â€ the company said in a statement.\r\n\r\nAn estimated 14,000 employees globally, or 15%, could lose jobs, including contractors, spokesman Casey Norton said. The figure will include loses from restructurings, retirements and performance-based exits. Exxon had about 88,300 workers, including 13,300 contractors, at the end of last year.\r\n\r\nThe company is not targeting a fixed number of jobs but does expect the result of its ongoing business review to eliminate about 15% of its current staffing.\r\n\r\nExxon, which has struggled in recent years to regain footing after misplaced bets on shale gas and Russia exploration, lost nearly $1.7 billion in the first six months of the year. It is expected to report a record-setting third straight quarterly loss on Friday, and its third-quarter loss could reach $1.19 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.\r\n\r\nExxon said the 1,900 U.S. job cuts will come mainly from its Houston-area campus, the headquarters for its U.S. oil and gas businesses.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, Exxon said it would cut 1,600 jobs in Europe. It has announced cuts in Australia.\r\n\r\nExxon shares were trading 4% higher at $32.85 on Thursday.\r\n\r\nPrior to the pandemic, Chief Executive Darren Woods pursued an ambitious spending plan to boost oil output in the belief a growing global middle class would demand more of its products.\r\n\r\nRoyal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L also have outlined up to 15% workforce cuts. Chevron Corpâ€™s CVX.N planned cuts of 10%-15% would imply a reduction of between 4,500 and 6,750 jobs. It will also cut roughly another 570 positions as part of its acquisition of Noble Energy.', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

We are standing up for ourselves, standing up for our country, standing up for our region and standing up for the planet,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nGuyanaâ€™s ministry of natural resources and the attorney generalâ€™s office did not respond to emailed requests for comment. ExxonMobil did not return calls seeking comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nIn April, Mike Cousins, ExxonMobilâ€™s senior vice president of exploration and new ventures, said in a statement that making progress on the companyâ€™s plans in Guyana was â€œvitalâ€ to unlock value from offshore resources for the countryâ€™s people.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said last month the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\n\"There is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,\" he added.

REUTERS/Nick Oxford\r\n\r\nBut smaller independent oil drillers without the resources of big corporations were more worried about Bidenâ€™s vow to toughen regulations and stop issuing new permits on federal lands, part of his sweeping plan to combat climate change and bring the economy to net zero emissions by 2050.\r\n\r\nFederal lands are the source of about 10% of U.S. oil and gas supply. Fossil fuels produced on federally managed lands and waters contribute nearly 25% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to government estimates, making them an easy target for the administrationâ€™s climate agenda.\r\n\r\nBidenâ€™s pledge would reverse former President Donald Trumpâ€™s efforts to maximize drilling and mining on federal property. In an order dated Wednesday, the Biden administration suspended oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days while it reviews the legal and policy implications of the mineral leasing program. But a freeze or ban will not end production in those areas overnight.\r\n\r\nThe seven companies that control half the federal supply onshore in the Lower 48 states have leases and permits in hand that could last years.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have always been very confident that we will continue to develop and drill on federal acreage,â€ said David Hager, executive chairman of Devon Energy Corp, the biggest oil producer on onshore federal land in the Lower 48 states. â€œItâ€™s embedded into the rights we have in the leases and weâ€™re doing it the right way.â€\r\n\r\nHe said he expected the companyâ€™s federal lands permits would last at least four years.\r\n\r\nOther top producers on federal land include EOG Resources Inc, ExxonMobil Corp, Occidental Petroleum Corp, ConocoPhillips, and Mewbourne Oil Company.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives at these companies did not comment for this article. But several have issued public statements saying they have solid stockpiles of federal permits and an ability to meet tougher emissions regulations expected under Biden. They have also said they can quickly shift drilling to state or private acreage once federal permits dry up.\r\n\r\nEOG has said it has at least four years of federal permits. â€œWhen it comes to access to federal lands, thatâ€™s one of the things weâ€™re not really worried about in our business. We have a lot of potential outside of federal land, too,â€ Chief Operating Officer Billy Helms said during an investor conference last year.\r\n\r\nOccidental said last year it had well over 200 federal drilling permits in hand and had requested another roughly 200 permits on New Mexico acreage, where some of the richest reserves lie beneath federally owned property.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\r\n\r\nAmeredev II, which produces about 10,000 barrels of oil per day in New Mexicoâ€™s Permian, also has federal drilling permits to last at least four years.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re trying to maximize our value against an uncertain range of possibilities,â€ said CEO Parker Reese.\r\n\r\nEnergy consultancy Rystad said it saw stockpiling of federal lands drilling permits in the run-up to the November presidential election, with federal permit requests rising to a 31% share of all permit requests in the major U.S. oilfields from 18% in 2019.\r\n\r\nBidenâ€™s team did not respond to several requests for comment.\r\n\r\nMost onshore federal drilling happens in Western states like New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming, which get a share of extraction royalties and depend on that revenue.\r\n\r\nAs Biden takes office, U.S. shale drilling industry has already declined sharply due to weak prices.\r\n\r\nTotal U.S. shale output is expected to fall to 7.5 million barrels per day in February, the U.S. Energy Department said on Tuesday, which would be the lowest since June 2020.\r\n\r\nShale drilling accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. crude oil production, but output is expected to decline throughout 2021 as producers rein in spending.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EXISTENTIAL THREATâ€™\r\n\r\nA large swathe of the industry is made up of smaller firms that lack the deep pockets to squirrel away permits, get a jumpstart on installing new emissions control technologies or take their business elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe impact on the independent oilman is a heck of a lot greater than it is on Big Oil,â€ said Don Law, owner of Denver-based Prima Exploration Inc, which produces about half of its 1,000 barrels of oil a day on federal lands, mainly in Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota.\r\n\r\nLaw called Bidenâ€™s promised policy â€œan existential threatâ€ unlike any he has encountered in 40 years in the oil business, echoing the rhetoric used by some climate activists about the threat posed by global warming.\r\n\r\nMany smaller drilling firms operate in a single state or basin, according to trade group Western Energy Alliance, and would struggle to pack up and leave.\r\n\r\nâ€œI actually live here,â€ said Mark Murphy, a third-generation oilman in New Mexico. His company, Strata Production Co, has 15 employees and operates 47 wells, mostly on federal acreage.\r\n\r\nWestern Energy Alliance, the oil and gas industry trade group most focused on public lands policy, has pledged to fight any efforts to impose a leasing ban in court. States that rely heavily on revenues from federal oil and gas drilling are also ramping up opposition.\r\n\r\nLast month Wyoming officials issued a study that said a ban would cost eight Western states $8.1 billion in tax revenue and $34.1 billion in investment in the next five years. The stateâ€™s governor, Mark Gordon, called the predictions â€œdevastating.â€\r\n\r\nNew Mexicoâ€™s Democratic Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham said in late 2019 that she would seek a waiver from any drilling ban imposed by a future administration.

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil companyâ€™s transition to cleaner fuels.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Exxonâ€™s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nExxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nThe reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxonâ€™s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said.\r\n\r\nSince the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxonâ€™s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,â€ Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.â€\r\n\r\nFurther goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said.\r\n\r\nâ€˜NOTABLE TURNâ€™\r\n\r\nThe targets are â€œencouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,â€ said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.â€\r\n\r\nThe new targets do not address product emissions, a â€œmain source of risk,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. â€œAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.â€\r\n\r\nExxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.\r\n\r\nLast week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels. Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management.\r\n\r\nIn May, Exxonâ€™s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock Inc, voted in favor of an independent chairman and against the re-election of two directors over Exxonâ€™s approach to climate risks.', 0);

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi/File Photo/File Photo\r\n\r\nExxon has fended off attempts in the past to get it to change its policies and leadership, but pressure has mounted since the top U.S. oil producer posted a historic annual loss for 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic slashed energy demand.\r\n\r\nThe company responded by reducing the value of its shale gas properties by more than $20 billion, cutting spending on new projects by nearly a third, laying off workers and adding $21 billion to its debt to cover spending.\r\n\r\nUbben founded activist investment firm ValueAct and now runs social impact investment firm Inclusive Capital, while Angelakis had served as Comcastâ€™s chief financial officer and now runs strategic investment company Atairos.\r\n\r\nExxon said their appointments increased the size of its board to 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. Earlier this year, Exxon named Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, a former chief executive officer of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, to the board.\r\n\r\nExxon said in a statement that Ubben and Angelakis would help the company as it â€œadvances plans to increase shareholder value by responsibly providing needed energy while playing a leadership role in the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nExxon, which was once Americaâ€™s most valuable company but now has a market value of only $240.6 billion, has faced fresh pressure from investors since late last year. The company is scheduled to hold its annual Investor Day this week.\r\n\r\nWhile running ValueAct, Ubben had long been viewed as a collaborative director who would work behind the scenes instead of publicly calling for the CEO to be fired.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, he has served as a director at energy company AES - he resigned on Monday because he was joining the Exxon board - where he helped the once coal-heavy power generator transition more to renewable energy. AESâ€™ share price more than doubled during his time on the board between early 2018 and now.\r\n\r\nIndustry analysts generally welcomed the board appointments, but some criticized them for not going far enough.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt remains to be seen how receptive Exxonâ€™s management will be to this pressure,â€ said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James, adding that â€œnot all board members share Ubbenâ€™s focus.â€\r\n\r\nThe move â€œlooks like a missed opportunity,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. â€œWhile the two candidates are impressive on their own, their appointments donâ€™t do anything to fill the gaps in experience on the Exxon board that have so concerned investors.â€\r\n\r\nFOCUS ON EMISSIONS\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a newly formed activist firm, publicly said it is trying to place four new directors on Exxonâ€™s board and prominent hedge fund D.E. Shaw said it is working behind the scenes to force change at the company. While best known as a fund that focuses on quantitative analysis, D.E. Shaw has pushed for change at Loweâ€™s Cos and Emerson Electric. Engine No. 1â€™s Charlie Penner was involved in many activist campaigns at Jana Partners.\r\n\r\nThe California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund is backing Engine No. 1, and other investors formed a coalition to push Exxon into making more sweeping changes.\r\n\r\nIn the face of that pressure, which some shareholders say will continue even as the new board members begin to advise the company on how it spends its money and focusing more on renewable energy, Exxon has cut its spending plans and disclosed updated emissions targets.\r\n\r\nD.E. Shaw said it welcomed the steps Exxon had taken in identifying cost savings and adding Ubben and Angelakis to the board, saying they will bring â€œsignificant capital markets and capital allocation experience to the boardroom and will provide meaningful value to the Company.â€\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1 said: â€œWe remain confident our nominees bring the right experience and skills to help put ExxonMobil on a path to sustainable, long-term value creation for the benefit of all shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nExxonâ€™s shares, which have lagged those of its closest rival Chevron Corp by a wide margin in the last five years, jumped 4.9% in trading to $57.02. The shares are up about 40% so far this year.\r\n\r\nSince December, Exxon has said it would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nIt also announced plans to commercialize technology that helps reduce carbon emissions and disclosed its Scope 3 emissions, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.', 0),

It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes.

U.S. fossil fuel giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have been unwavering about their commitment to drilling for black gold: As long as people are buying, theyâ€™re selling. With oil prices above $80 a barrel, the companiesâ€™ respective chiefs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth arenâ€™t in a bad place.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the $272 billion Exxon said that revenue jumped 60% in the three quarters ended in September compared with the same period last year, to $74 billion. Chevronâ€™s sales rose 83% over the same period. Production and capital expenditures didnâ€™t waver much at either company. Exxon said in prepared remarks that if commodity prices stay where they are, it expects earnings to double from 2019 levels by 2025.\r\n\r\nA swerve from European giants away from dirtier kinds of fuel has helped prices. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) are selling some fossil-fuel businesses. But the use of oil and gas, after being hit by the pandemic, has come roaring back just as the market became starved for investment. The number of rigs dropped by 40% since the end of 2019, according to Baker Hughes. Shell is now battling activist investor Dan Loeb, who wants it to split after making huge commitments to spending on renewable power.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nWoods and Wirth have stayed firm in their strategies over the past 18 months. Though Exxon instated new directors on its board that are focused on climate initiatives, theyâ€™ve forged ahead with discoveries in long-dated offshore drilling locations like Guyana. Last year, Chevron scooped up Noble Energy when the price of Brent crude was about half what it sells for today.\r\n\r\nThe gap between investment in fossil fuels and renewable energy is narrowing as capital expenditures in oil and gas fall, according to Rystad Energy. Meantime Exxonâ€™s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 is a fifth lower than at the start of the pandemic. It leaves the two U.S.-based drillers, and select giants elsewhere like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), in a mini sweet spot.

In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

U.S. fossil fuel giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have been unwavering about their commitment to drilling for black gold: As long as people are buying, theyâ€™re selling. With oil prices above $80 a barrel, the companiesâ€™ respective chiefs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth arenâ€™t in a bad place.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the $272 billion Exxon said that revenue jumped 60% in the three quarters ended in September compared with the same period last year, to $74 billion. Chevronâ€™s sales rose 83% over the same period. Production and capital expenditures didnâ€™t waver much at either company. Exxon said in prepared remarks that if commodity prices stay where they are, it expects earnings to double from 2019 levels by 2025.\r\n\r\nA swerve from European giants away from dirtier kinds of fuel has helped prices. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) are selling some fossil-fuel businesses. But the use of oil and gas, after being hit by the pandemic, has come roaring back just as the market became starved for investment. The number of rigs dropped by 40% since the end of 2019, according to Baker Hughes. Shell is now battling activist investor Dan Loeb, who wants it to split after making huge commitments to spending on renewable power.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nWoods and Wirth have stayed firm in their strategies over the past 18 months. Though Exxon instated new directors on its board that are focused on climate initiatives, theyâ€™ve forged ahead with discoveries in long-dated offshore drilling locations like Guyana. Last year, Chevron scooped up Noble Energy when the price of Brent crude was about half what it sells for today.\r\n\r\nThe gap between investment in fossil fuels and renewable energy is narrowing as capital expenditures in oil and gas fall, according to Rystad Energy. Meantime Exxonâ€™s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 is a fifth lower than at the start of the pandemic. It leaves the two U.S.-based drillers, and select giants elsewhere like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), in a mini sweet spot. It also challenges the idea â€“ at least for now â€“ that green investment neednâ€™t be an act of altruism.\r\n\r\nFollow @thereallsl on Twitter\r\n\r\nCONTEXT NEWS\r\n\r\n- Chevron said on Oct. 29 that third quarter total revenue including from affiliates was $45 billion, an 83% jump compared with the same period the previous year as the oil giantâ€™s total production rose 7%.\r\n\r\n- The same day, Exxon Mobil said its sales of $74 billion increased 60% year-on-year, as it pumped slightly less oil and other fossil fuels than during the same quarter a year earlier.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nEditing by John Foley and Amanda Gomez\r\n\r\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\r\n\r\nOpinions expressed are those of the author.

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

We are standing up for ourselves, standing up for our country, standing up for our region and standing up for the planet,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nGuyanaâ€™s ministry of natural resources and the attorney generalâ€™s office did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nAn ExxonMobil spokesman said by email that the company in Guyana complies â€œwith all applicable laws at every step of the exploration, appraisal, development and production stagesâ€.\r\n\r\nAssessments for each of Exxonâ€™s projects in Guyana â€œoutline potential environmental impacts and mitigationsâ€, he added.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said in April the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,â€ he added.', 0);

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

ExxonMobil did not return calls seeking comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nIn April, Mike Cousins, ExxonMobilâ€™s senior vice president of exploration and new ventures, said in a statement that making progress on the companyâ€™s plans in Guyana was â€œvitalâ€ to unlock value from offshore resources for the countryâ€™s people.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said last month the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\n\"There is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,\" he added.

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.â€\r\n\r\nThe new targets do not address product emissions, a â€œmain source of risk,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. â€œAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.â€\r\n\r\nExxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.\r\n\r\nLast week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels.

Earlier this year, Exxon named Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, a former chief executive officer of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, to the board.\r\n\r\nExxon said in a statement that Ubben and Angelakis would help the company as it â€œadvances plans to increase shareholder value by responsibly providing needed energy while playing a leadership role in the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nExxon, which was once Americaâ€™s most valuable company but now has a market value of only $240.6 billion, has faced fresh pressure from investors since late last year. The company is scheduled to hold its annual Investor Day this week.\r\n\r\nWhile running ValueAct, Ubben had long been viewed as a collaborative director who would work behind the scenes instead of publicly calling for the CEO to be fired.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, he has served as a director at energy company AES - he resigned on Monday because he was joining the Exxon board - where he helped the once coal-heavy power generator transition more to renewable energy. AESâ€™ share price more than doubled during his time on the board between early 2018 and now.\r\n\r\nIndustry analysts generally welcomed the board appointments, but some criticized them for not going far enough.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt remains to be seen how receptive Exxonâ€™s management will be to this pressure,â€ said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James, adding that â€œnot all board members share Ubbenâ€™s focus.â€\r\n\r\nThe move â€œlooks like a missed opportunity,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. â€œWhile the two candidates are impressive on their own, their appointments donâ€™t do anything to fill the gaps in experience on the Exxon board that have so concerned investors.â€\r\n\r\nFOCUS ON EMISSIONS\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a newly formed activist firm, publicly said it is trying to place four new directors on Exxonâ€™s board and prominent hedge fund D.E.

Engine No. 1â€™s Charlie Penner was involved in many activist campaigns at Jana Partners.\r\n\r\nThe California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund is backing Engine No. 1, and other investors formed a coalition to push Exxon into making more sweeping changes.\r\n\r\nIn the face of that pressure, which some shareholders say will continue even as the new board members begin to advise the company on how it spends its money and focusing more on renewable energy, Exxon has cut its spending plans and disclosed updated emissions targets.\r\n\r\nD.E. Shaw said it welcomed the steps Exxon had taken in identifying cost savings and adding Ubben and Angelakis to the board, saying they will bring â€œsignificant capital markets and capital allocation experience to the boardroom and will provide meaningful value to the Company.â€\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1 said: â€œWe remain confident our nominees bring the right experience and skills to help put ExxonMobil on a path to sustainable, long-term value creation for the benefit of all shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nExxonâ€™s shares, which have lagged those of its closest rival Chevron Corp by a wide margin in the last five years, jumped 4.9% in trading to $57.02.

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

REUTERS/Jessica Rinaldi/File Photo/File Photo\r\n\r\nExxon has fended off attempts in the past to get it to change its policies and leadership, but pressure has mounted since the top U.S. oil producer posted a historic annual loss for 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic slashed energy demand.\r\n\r\nThe company responded by reducing the value of its shale gas properties by more than $20 billion, cutting spending on new projects by nearly a third, laying off workers and adding $21 billion to its debt to cover spending.\r\n\r\nUbben founded activist investment firm ValueAct and now runs social impact investment firm Inclusive Capital, while Angelakis had served as Comcastâ€™s chief financial officer and now runs strategic investment company Atairos.\r\n\r\nExxon said their appointments increased the size of its board to 13 directors, 12 of whom are independent. Earlier this year, Exxon named Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, a former chief executive officer of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, to the board.\r\n\r\nExxon said in a statement that Ubben and Angelakis would help the company as it â€œadvances plans to increase shareholder value by responsibly providing needed energy while playing a leadership role in the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nExxon, which was once Americaâ€™s most valuable company but now has a market value of only $240.6 billion, has faced fresh pressure from investors since late last year. The company is scheduled to hold its annual Investor Day this week.\r\n\r\nWhile running ValueAct, Ubben had long been viewed as a collaborative director who would work behind the scenes instead of publicly calling for the CEO to be fired.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years, he has served as a director at energy company AES - he resigned on Monday because he was joining the Exxon board - where he helped the once coal-heavy power generator transition more to renewable energy. AESâ€™ share price more than doubled during his time on the board between early 2018 and now.\r\n\r\nIndustry analysts generally welcomed the board appointments, but some criticized them for not going far enough.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt remains to be seen how receptive Exxonâ€™s management will be to this pressure,â€ said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James, adding that â€œnot all board members share Ubbenâ€™s focus.â€\r\n\r\nThe move â€œlooks like a missed opportunity,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with institutional investors and companies. â€œWhile the two candidates are impressive on their own, their appointments donâ€™t do anything to fill the gaps in experience on the Exxon board that have so concerned investors.â€\r\n\r\nFOCUS ON EMISSIONS\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a newly formed activist firm, publicly said it is trying to place four new directors on Exxonâ€™s board and prominent hedge fund D.E. Shaw said it is working behind the scenes to force change at the company. While best known as a fund that focuses on quantitative analysis, D.E. Shaw has pushed for change at Loweâ€™s Cos and Emerson Electric. Engine No. 1â€™s Charlie Penner was involved in many activist campaigns at Jana Partners.\r\n\r\nThe California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund is backing Engine No. 1, and other investors formed a coalition to push Exxon into making more sweeping changes.\r\n\r\nIn the face of that pressure, which some shareholders say will continue even as the new board members begin to advise the company on how it spends its money and focusing more on renewable energy, Exxon has cut its spending plans and disclosed updated emissions targets.\r\n\r\nD.E. Shaw said it welcomed the steps Exxon had taken in identifying cost savings and adding Ubben and Angelakis to the board, saying they will bring â€œsignificant capital markets and capital allocation experience to the boardroom and will provide meaningful value to the Company.â€\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1 said: â€œWe remain confident our nominees bring the right experience and skills to help put ExxonMobil on a path to sustainable, long-term value creation for the benefit of all shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nExxonâ€™s shares, which have lagged those of its closest rival Chevron Corp by a wide margin in the last five years, jumped 4.9% in trading to $57.02. The shares are up about 40% so far this year.\r\n\r\nSince December, Exxon has said it would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nIt also announced plans to commercialize technology that helps reduce carbon emissions and disclosed its Scope 3 emissions, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.', 0),

Danhof said his questions on topics such as companiesâ€™ dealings with China or restrictions on financing gun makers were answered in only 13 of the 27 virtual shareholder meetings he and his representatives attended.\r\n\r\nâ€œCompanies used the crisis to set up question-and-answer sessions that are a joke,â€ Danhof said. His success rate was much higher when he could sit near a microphone or in a CEOâ€™s line of sight during in-person gatherings, he added.\r\n\r\nDanhof is not alone. Investors faced obstacles, such as not being able to ask questions or not having their inquiries addressed, about 55% of the time in a sample of 88 virtual shareholder meetings held this year and reviewed in a Hebrew University of Jerusalem study published this month.\r\n\r\nThe researchers did not provide such figures for in-person shareholder gatherings in previous years but estimated that this yearâ€™s virtual meetings had significantly increased the number of dodged questions.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, virtual shareholder meetings have been welcomed by many mom-and-pop investors, who would have otherwise had to travel to a companyâ€™s headquarters to attend amid the pandemic.\r\n\r\nBroadridge Financial Solutions Inc, the top technology vendor to companies for these events, said it helped run 1,494 virtual shareholder meetings this year, up from 326 last year, preserving a key ritual in the corporate calendar.\r\n\r\nYet many activists focused on environmental, social and corporate governance issues say the digital format can make it hard for them to hold companies accountable, given that Wall Streetâ€™s big institutional investors get access to top executives all year long.\r\n\r\nâ€œCompanies should not use the pandemic as a cover for silencing their investors,â€ New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who administers the stateâ€™s roughly $194 billion pension fund, said in a statement to Reuters. He said he wanted companies to use virtual meetings as a supplement to in-person shareholder gatherings, not a replacement.\r\n\r\nQuestions avoided this year ranged from online auctioneer eBay Inc declining to name directors who did not attend its online meeting to drug maker AbbVie Inc avoiding an inquiry on whether it would raise the cost of drugs during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nâ€œAs long-term investors, we were disappointed our question wasnâ€™t answered by AbbVie,â€ said Kate Monahan, shareholder engagement manager at the Friends Fiduciary Corporation, which invests roughly $480 million based on religious Quaker values.\r\n\r\nShe said she also posted her question on social media to attract attention but has yet to receive an answer from AbbVie.\r\n\r\nAbbvie did not respond to a request for comment. An eBay spokeswoman said the companyâ€™s shareholder meeting was well attended by its board, and that it focused on questions more relevant to its business â€œout of fairness to other shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nShareholder advocacy groups, including the Council of Institutional Investors (CII), last month asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look into the issue, including companies avoiding questions or not allowing shareholders to speak during virtual meetings.\r\n\r\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment. The securities regulator issued guidance in April instructing companies to be clear about how shareholders â€œcan remotely access, participate in, and voteâ€ in online meetings.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Common Retirement Fund, overseen by DiNapoli, voted against the re-election of directors sitting on the governance committees of AT&T Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Incâ€™s boards this year for restricting investor participation at their virtual meetings.\r\n\r\nBerkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment. An AT&T spokeswoman said via e-mail that its decision this year to tweak the format of its shareholder meeting, allowing the company to read comments on proxy proponentsâ€™ behalf, â€œlets us efficiently address the matters to be voted and then move on to additional content.â€\r\n\r\nA spokesman for the fund said it will vote against directors of companies that do not meet CIIâ€™s standards for virtual shareholder meetings.\r\n\r\nProxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co, which many funds turn to for advice on how to cast their shareholder votes, is considering recommending against directors at companies that ran this yearâ€™s virtual meetings poorly, its head of research and engagement Aaron Bertinetti said.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL GLITCHES\r\n\r\nThe snubbing of the activists has not always been intentional. As the pandemic spread in the spring, some companies had to switch to virtual meetings with little notice, resulting in technical glitches.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe technology is just catching up with the need to make virtual meetings the best in class,â€ said Lawrence Elbaum, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP, who often works with companies challenged by activists. He added that investors can also contact companies through investor relations and by writing letters any day of the year.\r\n\r\nSome activists argued, however, that public pressure on companies at shareholder meetings is more successful in triggering change. They pointed to oil major ExxonMobil Corpâ€™s move in 2018 to provide investors with a report on the impact of climate change after shareholders won a high-profile vote at its annual meeting the previous year.\r\n\r\nâ€œVirtual meetings provide another tool for companies who donâ€™t like dissent to shut it down,â€ said Doug Chia, the president of corporate governance consulting firm Soundboard Governance LLC.', 0),

Edited excerpts are below.\r\n\r\nQ. What did you learn from your first job?\r\n\r\nA. My first job before I graduated from college was working in the admissions office in the local community college in the town where I grew up, Lee College in Baytown, Texas. That set the stage for my career.\r\n\r\nI was already a really hard worker. I learned that from school and my parents were hard workers. But at that job, I learned about having respectful work relationships with my peers, how to solve problems and how to help students navigate their educational experience.\r\n\r\nQ. What was your worst job?\r\n\r\nA. My worst job was one where I was there for four days. I had been in ExxonMobil, in communications, but I had left because I thought this job opportunity was going to give me a bigger experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed up on the first day, the person who had hired me had gone on vacation and wasnâ€™t there. I was left in a cube for four days. Nobody talked to me, nobody came and took me to lunch. I had asked three times, â€œIs there something I can do?â€\r\n\r\nFour days after quitting, I called ExxonMobil and said, â€œCan I come back?â€ When I left, the person who hired me wasnâ€™t even back from the trip.\r\n\r\nIt taught me that one of the things thatâ€™s so critical is the onboarding process. When you hire someone, a lot of onboarding and communicating has to happen even before they arrive. It provides connection and helps them understand that theyâ€™re going to be an important part of the community.\r\n\r\nQ. What has been your biggest work-life challenge during the pandemic?\r\n\r\nA. My daughter and husband are in the house with me and in this whole pandemic weâ€™ve been navigating being in the house together. Thereâ€™s some joy in that, but there are some challenges.\r\n\r\nFinding your own individual space that has a door that can be closed was our first lesson, especially when she started back-to-school online. Sheâ€™s 10, and thereâ€™s no way she can do that independently without interrupting us all the time.\r\n\r\nChildren canâ€™t reason that youâ€™re on a call and canâ€™t deal with something. Having a babysitter come in who can help entertain during the times when we have to focus has been critical, even for just a couple of hours a day.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you have advice for someone just starting out right now?\r\n\r\nA. Attend something that allows you to network, or online events that maybe you didnâ€™t have time for in the past or that you might not have been able to make because they were in a different city.\r\n\r\nFor example, we hold a womenâ€™s leadership conference every year for women about to start their MBA program. Usually, about 600 to 700 women are able to come, but because we were online this year, we had 1,400 women who attended and many were women in India. These women were really taking advantage of what the pandemic was handing to them.\r\n\r\nQ. Have you been doing anything differently work-wise in these times?\r\n\r\nA. Weâ€™ve been doing a sanity soundoff every week during the pandemic, which is some time for personal conversations to check in and see how everyone is doing.\r\n\r\nQ. Where will you travel to first when the world opens up again?\r\n\r\nA. Our MBA womenâ€™s leadership conference will be in Los Angeles in June 2021. If that happens, that will be my first trip. For pleasure, after all of this, I would like to go to Hawaii and enjoy the beach.\r\n\r\n(This story corrects location of FortÃ© to Austin, Texas)', 0),

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0);

REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil companyâ€™s transition to cleaner fuels.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Exxonâ€™s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nExxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nThe reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxonâ€™s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said.\r\n\r\nSince the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxonâ€™s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,â€ Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.â€\r\n\r\nFurther goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said.\r\n\r\nâ€˜NOTABLE TURNâ€™\r\n\r\nThe targets are â€œencouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,â€ said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.â€\r\n\r\nThe new targets do not address product emissions, a â€œmain source of risk,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. â€œAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.â€\r\n\r\nExxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.\r\n\r\nLast week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels. Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which has $50 billion under management.\r\n\r\nIn May, Exxonâ€™s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock Inc, voted in favor of an independent chairman and against the re-election of two directors over Exxonâ€™s approach to climate risks.', 0),

Danhof said his questions on topics such as companiesâ€™ dealings with China or restrictions on financing gun makers were answered in only 13 of the 27 virtual shareholder meetings he and his representatives attended.\r\n\r\nâ€œCompanies used the crisis to set up question-and-answer sessions that are a joke,â€ Danhof said. His success rate was much higher when he could sit near a microphone or in a CEOâ€™s line of sight during in-person gatherings, he added.\r\n\r\nDanhof is not alone. Investors faced obstacles, such as not being able to ask questions or not having their inquiries addressed, about 55% of the time in a sample of 88 virtual shareholder meetings held this year and reviewed in a Hebrew University of Jerusalem study published this month.\r\n\r\nThe researchers did not provide such figures for in-person shareholder gatherings in previous years but estimated that this yearâ€™s virtual meetings had significantly increased the number of dodged questions.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, virtual shareholder meetings have been welcomed by many mom-and-pop investors, who would have otherwise had to travel to a companyâ€™s headquarters to attend amid the pandemic.\r\n\r\nBroadridge Financial Solutions Inc, the top technology vendor to companies for these events, said it helped run 1,494 virtual shareholder meetings this year, up from 326 last year, preserving a key ritual in the corporate calendar.\r\n\r\nYet many activists focused on environmental, social and corporate governance issues say the digital format can make it hard for them to hold companies accountable, given that Wall Streetâ€™s big institutional investors get access to top executives all year long.\r\n\r\nâ€œCompanies should not use the pandemic as a cover for silencing their investors,â€ New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who administers the stateâ€™s roughly $194 billion pension fund, said in a statement to Reuters. He said he wanted companies to use virtual meetings as a supplement to in-person shareholder gatherings, not a replacement.\r\n\r\nQuestions avoided this year ranged from online auctioneer eBay Inc declining to name directors who did not attend its online meeting to drug maker AbbVie Inc avoiding an inquiry on whether it would raise the cost of drugs during the pandemic.\r\n\r\nâ€œAs long-term investors, we were disappointed our question wasnâ€™t answered by AbbVie,â€ said Kate Monahan, shareholder engagement manager at the Friends Fiduciary Corporation, which invests roughly $480 million based on religious Quaker values.\r\n\r\nShe said she also posted her question on social media to attract attention but has yet to receive an answer from AbbVie.\r\n\r\nAbbvie did not respond to a request for comment. An eBay spokeswoman said the companyâ€™s shareholder meeting was well attended by its board, and that it focused on questions more relevant to its business â€œout of fairness to other shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nShareholder advocacy groups, including the Council of Institutional Investors (CII), last month asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to look into the issue, including companies avoiding questions or not allowing shareholders to speak during virtual meetings.\r\n\r\nAn SEC spokesman declined to comment. The securities regulator issued guidance in April instructing companies to be clear about how shareholders â€œcan remotely access, participate in, and voteâ€ in online meetings.\r\n\r\nThe New York State Common Retirement Fund, overseen by DiNapoli, voted against the re-election of directors sitting on the governance committees of AT&T Inc and Berkshire Hathaway Incâ€™s boards this year for restricting investor participation at their virtual meetings.\r\n\r\nBerkshire Hathaway did not respond to requests for comment.

As the pandemic spread in the spring, some companies had to switch to virtual meetings with little notice, resulting in technical glitches.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe technology is just catching up with the need to make virtual meetings the best in class,â€ said Lawrence Elbaum, a partner at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP, who often works with companies challenged by activists. He added that investors can also contact companies through investor relations and by writing letters any day of the year.\r\n\r\nSome activists argued, however, that public pressure on companies at shareholder meetings is more successful in triggering change. They pointed to oil major ExxonMobil Corpâ€™s move in 2018 to provide investors with a report on the impact of climate change after shareholders won a high-profile vote at its annual meeting the previous year.\r\n\r\nâ€œVirtual meetings provide another tool for companies who donâ€™t like dissent to shut it down,â€ said Doug Chia, the president of corporate governance consulting firm Soundboard Governance LLC.', 0),

REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil companyâ€™s transition to cleaner fuels.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Exxonâ€™s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nExxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nThe reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxonâ€™s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said.\r\n\r\nSince the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxonâ€™s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,â€ Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.â€\r\n\r\nFurther goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said.\r\n\r\nâ€˜NOTABLE TURNâ€™\r\n\r\nThe targets are â€œencouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,â€ said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.â€\r\n\r\nThe new targets do not address product emissions, a â€œmain source of risk,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. â€œAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.â€\r\n\r\nExxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.\r\n\r\nLast week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels. Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\r\n\r\nDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil majors are at the sharp end of the climate debate and face a bewildering balancing act to secure their futures.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a Catch-22 situation: to meet ambitious emissions targets by investing in low-carbon technologies, they will have to rely on revenue from expanding their businesses in oil and gas, for which there is still growing global demand.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, they must satisfy the big investors who are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters; yet on the other, they canâ€™t risk cutting the generous dividends that keep shareholders sweet.\r\n\r\nHow energy companies navigate this maze could determine the winners and losers in a lower-carbon future, and help govern whether the world can rein in warming. So no pressure, then.\r\n\r\nThe confusion has been thrown into stark relief this week at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where oil majors, state oil giants and ministers have been debating behind closed doors in their biggest gathering of the year.\r\n\r\nWhile climate activists, notably Greta Thunberg, have called for all fossil fuel production to be halted to avert catastrophe, U.S President Donald Trump has decried â€œprophets of doomâ€ and hailed the economic importance of oil and gas.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt feels like we are at the epicenter of this debate. We sit right there between energy needs and climate change,â€ said Al Cook, executive vice-president of Norwayâ€™s energy giant Equinor.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you listen to Davos speeches, youâ€™ve got some people who say only economic growth and energy matter. Others ask to stop oil and gas immediately. We need to find a way to balance this but the challenge is that you cannot always be popular with either side,â€ Cook told Reuters.\r\n\r\nCLEAN ENERGY: FRACTION OF CAPEX\r\n\r\nRepsol is at the vanguard of an industry climate drive, announcing this year that it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. As a result, Norwayâ€™s wealth fund has doubled its stake in the Spanish energy firm.\r\n\r\nEquinor has meanwhile launched a target to reduce emissions to near zero in Norwegian offshore production by 2050, and is co-investing in a $10 billion wind farm in Britain, the worldâ€™s largest.\r\n\r\nFrench oil major Total this year announced investments into one of the worldâ€™s largest solar power plants, in Qatar. It also plans to open 20,000 power charging points in the Netherlands and invest in planting millions of trees in Peru.\r\n\r\nEuropeâ€™s top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Shell has set out an â€œambitionâ€ to halve â€œScope 3â€ emissions by 2050 from fuels and products sold to customers rather than from its own operations.\r\n\r\nReuters reported this week that BP is also looking to significantly broaden its targets.\r\n\r\nCompanies might tout green credentials to satisfy sustainable investors and activists, but how can they pay the bill?\r\n\r\nFatih Birol the head of the International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog for industrialized nations, said the reality was that industry investments in clean energy represented a small fraction of their spending.\r\n\r\nâ€œLast year only 1% of total capex went into clean technologies. But those investments will grow as companies have to balance their short-term profit goals with long-term social license,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œSome companies wonâ€™t need to borrow more, some companies may need to borrow more, but no company will stay unaffected by the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nHe said the industry would focus in coming years on reducing methane emissions from their own operations, which constitute 15% of all global greenhouse emissions.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis part can be done relatively inexpensively,â€ he added. â€œThe more expensive part will include carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and increased use of hydrogen.â€\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMP EFFECT\r\n\r\nAnother major challenge to climate action is a lack of a global consensus.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, where Trump is encouraging oil and gas production and has exited the Paris climate deal, oil majors lag their European rivals on emissions goals. Chevron has set limited reduction targets while ExxonMobil has no targets.\r\n\r\nA U.S. energy boom has helped make the country one of the worldâ€™s biggest gas flarers.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,â€ said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum.\r\n\r\nJafar argues that if the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, would need incentives to switch from cheaper coal, he said.\r\n\r\nBirol also said coal-fired plants were the main global source of emissions. â€œThe problem is how to address this coal issue without hurting those developing countries.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThe efforts of the West will be futile without bringing on board Asia and Africa, which are driving the growth in energy demand and emissions,â€ Jafar added.\r\n\r\nRichard Herrington, head of earth sciences at Londonâ€™s National History Museum also said a speedy energy transition may simply be impossible.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf the UK were to turn tomorrow all of its cars into electric ones, we would need twice the world annual cobalt and half of annual copper production,â€ he said. â€œYou can imagine what happens if you scale it up to the whole world.â€', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

Excluding the impairment and other charges, the company earned 3 cents per share, beating analystsâ€™ average expectation of a one-cent gain, according to Refinitiv IBES data.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe turnaround story will take some time,â€ said Biraj Borkhataria, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting that the company is not yet covering its dividend and capital spending with cash from operations.\r\n\r\nLOWER OUTPUT IN OIL AND REFINING\r\n\r\nExxonâ€™s oil and gas output was 3.7 million barrels of oil and gas per day in the quarter, down 8% compared with a year earlier.\r\n\r\nExploration and production, Exxonâ€™s largest business, lost $18.5 billion in the fourth quarter on the natural gas asset impairments, compared with a profit of $6.1 billion the year prior.\r\n\r\nIts chemicals business earned $691 million on better margins in part from lower oil prices, up from a loss of $355 million a year ago. Refining lost $1.2 billion, compared with profit of $898 million last year, on weak margins and lower output as the pandemic limited global travel.\r\n\r\nThe writedown lays bare the size of the miscalculation that the company made in 2010 when it paid $30 billion for U.S. shale oil and gas producer XTO Energy.

They do not reflect the views of Reuters News, which, under the Trust Principles, is committed to integrity, independence, and freedom from bias. Reuters Professional is owned by Thomson Reuters.\r\n\r\nOur Standards: here\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nTackling methane emissions, a greenhouse gas 84 times more potent than CO2 in the short term, should be low-hanging fruit for oil and gas producers: something they can do cost-effectively, and with far greater climate impact than investing in renewables, or in further-out technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage.\r\n\r\nAnd unlike CO2, which is 90% about the end use of their products, methane sits squarely in the industryâ€™s wheelhouse. A main component of both natural gas and oil, the odourless and colourless gas is either intentionally released or leaks during the drilling of wells; through incomplete combustion of gas; and in production, processing, transÂ¬portation and storage.\r\n\r\nBecause methane is shorter-lived in the atmosphere, it has taken a backseat to CO2 in the fight against climate change. But that changed in May, when the UN Environment Programme reported that cutting methane emissions by half this decade could stave off nearly 0.3Â° of warming by the 2040s. Its message was supported by the IEAâ€™s Methane Tracker, which found that oil and gas operations worldwide emitted more than 70m tonnes of methane into the atmosphere last year, equal to the energy-related CO2 emissions from Europe.\r\n\r\nâ€œEarly action on methane emissions will be critical for avoiding the worst effects of climate change,â€ says Dr Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA). â€œThere is no good reason to allow these harmful leaks to continue, and there is every reason for responsible operators to ensure that they are addressed.â€\r\n\r\nCertainly the big listed oil and gas producers have made a play about efforts to reduce methane emissions, which they report to investors and regulators, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But numerous academic studies using satellites have shown that the sectorâ€™s methane emissions are substantially higher than annual greenhouse gas estimates (GHGI) by the EPA.\r\n\r\nResearch carried out for the Environmental Defense Fund in 2012-2018 found actual methane emissions were 60% higher than data reported to the EPA, while the latest study, in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, estimates that in its latest GHGI the EPA under-reports methane emissions from oil production by a factor of two.\r\n\r\nNow a new dataset, seen by Reuters Professional, has become the first to attribute methane emissions to individual companies and benchmark them on their performance, using global satellite data of 7km resolution as well as ultra-high-resolution satellite probes in Canada and U.S., which have accuracy of 25m or better.\r\n\r\nIt finds some significant discrepancies between expected emissions from the major oil and gas producers, based on their disclosures and policies, and how they are performing in reality, according to Geofinancial Analytics, which is collaborating with Signal Climate Analytics in a year-long project with Reuters Professional assessing the climate performance of the biggest 250 global emitters.\r\n\r\nGeofinancial Analyticsâ€™s MethaneScanÂ® benchmark scores the oil and gas producers based on observed methane emissions in the year to this July. This first snapshot, of the top 15 producers, finds that oil super-majors Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are the worst performers, followed by ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nWhile Suncor, TotalEnergies and Pioneer Natural Resources performed better among the group, all scored well below â€œbestâ€, an indication of no methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark also compares observed emissions with how the companies would have been expected to perform based on a combined metric of their methane intensity reports, regulatory filings, commitment to transparent reporting, and safety incidents. Again, Shell and Chevron under-performed, while scores for Equinor, EOG, ENI, Suncor and Total were relatively well aligned with company self-disclosures and expectations.\r\n\r\nMark Kriss, CEO of Geofinancial Analytics, said â€œScientific studies are showing a very significant contribution [from oil and gas producers] and a very significant increase in that contribution in the last 10 years on this critical issue. We need to know where these point sources are coming from, not just at the regional level, but at the company and wellhead level.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are starting to see that some companies are managing this better than othersâ€¦ They are all clustering in the â€˜not so goodâ€™ area, and some are hovering on poor, but none are anywhere near the â€˜bestâ€™ zone.â€\r\n\r\nGeofinancial analysed 600,000 medium-resolution satellite scans of 3m wellheads in North America, Brazil, Australia and Europe, but ultra-high resolution satellite imagery is currently only available for facilities in the U.S. and Canada. Outside North America, the benchmark is built on association with elevated methane at 7km of resolution.\r\n\r\nIn the North American context, Kriss said Shellâ€™s performance was the biggest surprise, given its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050 and its announced target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe airborne methane in the environs of Chevron and Shell across all their on-shore wellheads in the geographies we cover were slightly higher than Exxonâ€™s,â€ he said. This is particularly the case in facilities in the Gulf region, he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s findings were shared with Shell, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, which all defended their efforts to tackle methane emissions, including their own use of high-resolution satellites, while taking issue with the benchmarkâ€™s methodology.\r\n\r\nA ConocoPhillips spokesman said: â€œWe believe the benchmark has limitations such as emissions in a certain area being attributed to a company based on wellhead density, and other non-well site emissions being ignored (for example, third-party pipelines). Furthermore, in areas like the Permian, where operators work in close proximity to one another, our experience has been that it is hard for satellites to accurately pinpoint the source of emissions.â€\r\n\r\nA Chevron spokesman said: â€œWe are concerned that the underlying data and assumptions used in [Geofinancialâ€™s] analysis may not be sufficiently robust to accurately attribute emissions to specific operators or support the generation of a company-by-company credit-style ranking for methane emissions in select basins in North America.â€ However, it added: â€œOver time, their models and analysis have the potential to improve as additional information becomes available to them.â€\r\n\r\nShell took issue with the large number of wellheads Geofinancial had attributed to the company. â€œShell currently owns and operates fewer than 2,000 onshore wellheads in all of North Americaâ€, a spokesperson said.\r\n\r\nShe added: â€œWe are taking actions to effectively reduce our emissions and have previously announced a target to keep methane emissions intensity for operated oil and gas assets below 0.2% by 2025, which we are achieving.â€\r\n\r\nKriss said ownership data used in the benchmark, which includes majority-owned subsidiaries, is based on corporate filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. â€œThereâ€™s always a lag between publicly available data and what the company knows is true. But we need to rely on the public data, because thatâ€™s the only way we can have an objective, comprehensive view of whatâ€™s going on,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nGeofinancialâ€™s methodology doesnâ€™t let companies off the hook in the case that they may have divested of high-polluting and aging assets, and attributes methane emissions of divested assets for five years, but at a declining rate.\r\n\r\nKriss said that in Shellâ€™s case, the discrepancy may be partially accounted for by the large number of inactive wells associated with Shellâ€™s legacy operations over decades as well as recent divestitures, which have not yet been discounted in MethaneScanâ€™s scores.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out that all scores incorporate abandoned wells, which, though no longer on companiesâ€™ books, â€œcan be a significant source of recurring methane emissions over long periods of timeâ€.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of EPA data from 2019 by energy consultancy M.J. Bradley & Associates in May showed that methane leakage doesnâ€™t go away when big oil and gas companies divest of older and dirtier assets â€“ often to smaller players where there is far less transparency, and less incentive to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nThe analysis found that five of the industryâ€™s top 10 emitters of methane were little-known oil and gas producers. The biggest polluter, privately owned Hilcorp Energy, had bought up old gas wells in northern New Mexico from ExxonMobil in 2017, which that year reported its greenhouse gas emissions had fallen 20%.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a trend that will only accelerate as the heat gets turned up under the industry in the wake of this weekâ€™s report from the IPCC.\r\n\r\nKris described the current MethaneScanÂ® benchmark as â€œjust the beginning of a new era of radical transparencyâ€ on methane emissions by the oil and gas sector. He said future benchmarks would be improved as Geofinancial added observations from another eight ultra-high-resolution satellites by the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nDavid Lubin, chairman of Signal Climate Analytics, said that Geofinancial Analyticsâ€™ methane emissions observations are a critical component of Signalâ€™s ongoing work with Reuters Professional tracking the levels of transparency among the 250 largest publicly traded greenhouse gas emitters.\r\n\r\nLater in 2021, he said, Signal will add a Transparency Ratioâ„¢ to its company-level assessments, which will compare their public disclosures with real-world requirements for transparency on emissions where they have the most impact.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile companies are surely disclosing volumes of emissions data, and metrics, often in support of company narratives on climate action, real transparency can only be achieved when the most critical emissions for a sector are fully disclosed by the company,â€ Lubin said. â€œFrom the work of Geofinancial, itâ€™s clear that for the oil and gas sector any claim of transparency must include a full accounting of methane emissions.â€\r\n\r\n<<\r\n\r\nSignal Climate Analytics is studying 250 of the worldâ€™s biggest CO2 emitters to analyse the impact of their plans to cut emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. Reuters Professional has an agreement with Signal to publish stories based on these datasets.\r\n\r\n<<', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

The reason the talks ended could not be learned.\r\n\r\nThe sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Exxon and Chevron, which have market capitalizations of $190 billion and $164 billion, respectively, declined to comment.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevronâ€™s shares nosedived last year after a Saudi-Russian price war and fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak caused the value of oil to crater. Exxonâ€™s stock was hit hardest, as investors raised concerns about the companyâ€™s long-term profitability and spending decisions.\r\n\r\nIn their talks, the CEOs of Exxon and Chevron envisioned achieving synergies through massive cost cuts to help weather the downturn in energy markets, one of the sources said. At the end of 2019, Exxon employed about 75,000 people and Chevron roughly 48,000.\r\n\r\nFollowing the aborted talks with Exxon, Chevron went on to acquire oil producer Noble Energy in a $5 billion cash-and-stock deal that was completed in October.\r\n\r\nA proposed combination last year would almost certainly have triggered an intense antitrust review by the U.S. Justice Department, a process that typically takes months to complete. And such a review would also potentially have run up against last Novemberâ€™s U.S. presidential election, raising additional uncertainty about how soon such a deal might be cleared, if at all.\r\n\r\nNow, under the Biden administration, the window might be all but closed as Democrats historically have been less sympathetic to such deals, one of the sources said. President Joe Biden has put climate change at the forefront of his agenda, promoting jobs in renewable energy as opposed to traditional ones in the oil sector.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015./File Photo\r\n\r\nBiden recently formally revoked the permit to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline. General Motors last week said it would aim to stop selling vehicles powered by gasoline and diesel, which rely on oil, by 2035.\r\n\r\nThe White House and Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nNews of the unsuccessful talks emerged as Exxon has come under pressure from some of its shareholders over its strategic direction.\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, a investment firm based in San Francisco, last week nominated four directors to Exxonâ€™s board and is pushing the company to spend its cash better, preserve its dividend, and invest more in clean energy. Exxon is also in the crosshairs of hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which is pressuring the company to cut costs and improve performance.\r\n\r\nExxon reports fourth-quarter results on Feb. 2. Chevron last week reported a surprise $11 million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED GIANT\r\n\r\nA combined Exxon-Chevron would be eclipsed in size only by Saudi Aramco, which boasts a roughly $1.8 trillion market value and has previously pushed many U.S. drillers to the financial brink by flooding the market with oil.\r\n\r\nDespite inevitable antitrust concerns, the companies could argue a merger would represent the United Statesâ€™ best shot at taking on the Saudi state-owned conglomerate and the worldâ€™s other largest state-backed oil producers, one of the sources said.\r\n\r\nLast yearâ€™s Saudi-Russian oil price war, for instance, highlighted the vulnerability of U.S. producers to foreign governments that can effectively dictate the price of crude by forcing energy companies they back to boost or cut output.\r\n\r\nU.S. oil companies each compete among one another and set their own varying production targets, with limited ability of Washington to intervene.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron, with their powerful balance sheets, withstood turmoil in energy markets following the pandemic that forced some smaller independent oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy protection.\r\n\r\nYet they also felt the pain. Demand for oil evaporated in early 2020 as governments imposed travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders to slow the COVID-19 pandemicâ€™s spread.\r\n\r\nAt one point in April, the price of U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures turned negative for the first time ever, signifying sellers needed to pay buyers to take the commodity off their hands. Prices have since rebounded to roughly $52 a barrel.\r\n\r\nExxon and Chevron have both cut jobs over the past year. Exxon late last year left its dividend flat after boosting the shareholder payout each year since 1982.', 0),

In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\r\n\r\nDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Oil majors are at the sharp end of the climate debate and face a bewildering balancing act to secure their futures.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s a Catch-22 situation: to meet ambitious emissions targets by investing in low-carbon technologies, they will have to rely on revenue from expanding their businesses in oil and gas, for which there is still growing global demand.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, they must satisfy the big investors who are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters; yet on the other, they canâ€™t risk cutting the generous dividends that keep shareholders sweet.\r\n\r\nHow energy companies navigate this maze could determine the winners and losers in a lower-carbon future, and help govern whether the world can rein in warming. So no pressure, then.\r\n\r\nThe confusion has been thrown into stark relief this week at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where oil majors, state oil giants and ministers have been debating behind closed doors in their biggest gathering of the year.\r\n\r\nWhile climate activists, notably Greta Thunberg, have called for all fossil fuel production to be halted to avert catastrophe, U.S President Donald Trump has decried â€œprophets of doomâ€ and hailed the economic importance of oil and gas.\r\n\r\nâ€œIt feels like we are at the epicenter of this debate. We sit right there between energy needs and climate change,â€ said Al Cook, executive vice-president of Norwayâ€™s energy giant Equinor.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf you listen to Davos speeches, youâ€™ve got some people who say only economic growth and energy matter. Others ask to stop oil and gas immediately. We need to find a way to balance this but the challenge is that you cannot always be popular with either side,â€ Cook told Reuters.\r\n\r\nCLEAN ENERGY: FRACTION OF CAPEX\r\n\r\nRepsol is at the vanguard of an industry climate drive, announcing this year that it plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. As a result, Norwayâ€™s wealth fund has doubled its stake in the Spanish energy firm.\r\n\r\nEquinor has meanwhile launched a target to reduce emissions to near zero in Norwegian offshore production by 2050, and is co-investing in a $10 billion wind farm in Britain, the worldâ€™s largest.\r\n\r\nFrench oil major Total this year announced investments into one of the worldâ€™s largest solar power plants, in Qatar. It also plans to open 20,000 power charging points in the Netherlands and invest in planting millions of trees in Peru.\r\n\r\nEuropeâ€™s top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Shell has set out an â€œambitionâ€ to halve â€œScope 3â€ emissions by 2050 from fuels and products sold to customers rather than from its own operations.\r\n\r\nReuters reported this week that BP is also looking to significantly broaden its targets.\r\n\r\nCompanies might tout green credentials to satisfy sustainable investors and activists, but how can they pay the bill?\r\n\r\nFatih Birol the head of the International Energy Agency, the energy watchdog for industrialized nations, said the reality was that industry investments in clean energy represented a small fraction of their spending.\r\n\r\nâ€œLast year only 1% of total capex went into clean technologies. But those investments will grow as companies have to balance their short-term profit goals with long-term social license,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œSome companies wonâ€™t need to borrow more, some companies may need to borrow more, but no company will stay unaffected by the energy transition.â€\r\n\r\nHe said the industry would focus in coming years on reducing methane emissions from their own operations, which constitute 15% of all global greenhouse emissions.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis part can be done relatively inexpensively,â€ he added. â€œThe more expensive part will include carbon capture and storage, offshore wind and increased use of hydrogen.â€\r\n\r\nTHE TRUMP EFFECT\r\n\r\nAnother major challenge to climate action is a lack of a global consensus.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, where Trump is encouraging oil and gas production and has exited the Paris climate deal, oil majors lag their European rivals on emissions goals. Chevron has set limited reduction targets while ExxonMobil has no targets.\r\n\r\nA U.S. energy boom has helped make the country one of the worldâ€™s biggest gas flarers.\r\n\r\nâ€œNo-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,â€ said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum.\r\n\r\nJafar argues that if the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, would need incentives to switch from cheaper coal, he said.\r\n\r\nBirol also said coal-fired plants were the main global source of emissions. â€œThe problem is how to address this coal issue without hurting those developing countries.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œThe efforts of the West will be futile without bringing on board Asia and Africa, which are driving the growth in energy demand and emissions,â€ Jafar added.\r\n\r\nRichard Herrington, head of earth sciences at Londonâ€™s National History Museum also said a speedy energy transition may simply be impossible.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf the UK were to turn tomorrow all of its cars into electric ones, we would need twice the world annual cobalt and half of annual copper production,â€ he said. â€œYou can imagine what happens if you scale it up to the whole world.â€', 0),

Helping women to break the glass ceiling', 'NEW YORK - Elissa Sangster counts herself fortunate to have had early mentors who pushed to empower and promote women around them.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: Forte Foundation CEO Elissa Sangster poses in an undated handout photo. Forte Foundation/Handout via REUTERS\r\n\r\nAfter business school, Sangster worked at Texas A&M University as assistant director of the MBA program, whose director, Sue Robertson, was her supervisor.\r\n\r\nâ€œShe was very much a supporter of women,â€ said Sangster, now the chief executive of FortÃ©, an Austin, Texas-based nonprofit that focuses on elevating women to leadership positions. â€œShe had faced a lot of challenges that were gender-related in her career and she wanted me to have opportunity.â€\r\n\r\nSangster applies that spirit in her work now to help women pursue MBAs and rise up in their work places.\r\n\r\nSangster chatted with Reuters about her work philosophy. Edited excerpts are below.\r\n\r\nQ. What did you learn from your first job?\r\n\r\nA. My first job before I graduated from college was working in the admissions office in the local community college in the town where I grew up, Lee College in Baytown, Texas. That set the stage for my career.\r\n\r\nI was already a really hard worker. I learned that from school and my parents were hard workers. But at that job, I learned about having respectful work relationships with my peers, how to solve problems and how to help students navigate their educational experience.\r\n\r\nQ. What was your worst job?\r\n\r\nA. My worst job was one where I was there for four days. I had been in ExxonMobil, in communications, but I had left because I thought this job opportunity was going to give me a bigger experience.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed up on the first day, the person who had hired me had gone on vacation and wasnâ€™t there. I was left in a cube for four days. Nobody talked to me, nobody came and took me to lunch. I had asked three times, â€œIs there something I can do?â€\r\n\r\nFour days after quitting, I called ExxonMobil and said, â€œCan I come back?â€ When I left, the person who hired me wasnâ€™t even back from the trip.\r\n\r\nIt taught me that one of the things thatâ€™s so critical is the onboarding process. When you hire someone, a lot of onboarding and communicating has to happen even before they arrive. It provides connection and helps them understand that theyâ€™re going to be an important part of the community.\r\n\r\nQ. What has been your biggest work-life challenge during the pandemic?\r\n\r\nA. My daughter and husband are in the house with me and in this whole pandemic weâ€™ve been navigating being in the house together. Thereâ€™s some joy in that, but there are some challenges.\r\n\r\nFinding your own individual space that has a door that can be closed was our first lesson, especially when she started back-to-school online. Sheâ€™s 10, and thereâ€™s no way she can do that independently without interrupting us all the time.\r\n\r\nChildren canâ€™t reason that youâ€™re on a call and canâ€™t deal with something. Having a babysitter come in who can help entertain during the times when we have to focus has been critical, even for just a couple of hours a day.\r\n\r\nQ. Do you have advice for someone just starting out right now?\r\n\r\nA. Attend something that allows you to network, or online events that maybe you didnâ€™t have time for in the past or that you might not have been able to make because they were in a different city.\r\n\r\nFor example, we hold a womenâ€™s leadership conference every year for women about to start their MBA program. Usually, about 600 to 700 women are able to come, but because we were online this year, we had 1,400 women who attended and many were women in India. These women were really taking advantage of what the pandemic was handing to them.\r\n\r\nQ. Have you been doing anything differently work-wise in these times?\r\n\r\nA. Weâ€™ve been doing a sanity soundoff every week during the pandemic, which is some time for personal conversations to check in and see how everyone is doing.\r\n\r\nQ. Where will you travel to first when the world opens up again?\r\n\r\nA. Our MBA womenâ€™s leadership conference will be in Los Angeles in June 2021. If that happens, that will be my first trip. For pleasure, after all of this, I would like to go to Hawaii and enjoy the beach.\r\n\r\n(This story corrects location of FortÃ© to Austin, Texas)', 0),
(217, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Development and impact of infrusturce investments and services supported ', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters.

It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research.

Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

U.S. fossil fuel giants Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) have been unwavering about their commitment to drilling for black gold: As long as people are buying, theyâ€™re selling. With oil prices above $80 a barrel, the companiesâ€™ respective chiefs Darren Woods and Mike Wirth arenâ€™t in a bad place.\r\n\r\nOn Friday the $272 billion Exxon said that revenue jumped 60% in the three quarters ended in September compared with the same period last year, to $74 billion. Chevronâ€™s sales rose 83% over the same period. Production and capital expenditures didnâ€™t waver much at either company. Exxon said in prepared remarks that if commodity prices stay where they are, it expects earnings to double from 2019 levels by 2025.\r\n\r\nA swerve from European giants away from dirtier kinds of fuel has helped prices. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) are selling some fossil-fuel businesses. But the use of oil and gas, after being hit by the pandemic, has come roaring back just as the market became starved for investment. The number of rigs dropped by 40% since the end of 2019, according to Baker Hughes. Shell is now battling activist investor Dan Loeb, who wants it to split after making huge commitments to spending on renewable power.\r\n\r\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\r\n\r\nWoods and Wirth have stayed firm in their strategies over the past 18 months. Though Exxon instated new directors on its board that are focused on climate initiatives, theyâ€™ve forged ahead with discoveries in long-dated offshore drilling locations like Guyana. Last year, Chevron scooped up Noble Energy when the price of Brent crude was about half what it sells for today.\r\n\r\nThe gap between investment in fossil fuels and renewable energy is narrowing as capital expenditures in oil and gas fall, according to Rystad Energy. Meantime Exxonâ€™s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12 is a fifth lower than at the start of the pandemic. It leaves the two U.S.-based drillers, and select giants elsewhere like Saudi Aramco (2222.SE), in a mini sweet spot.

We are standing up for ourselves, standing up for our country, standing up for our region and standing up for the planet,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nGuyanaâ€™s ministry of natural resources and the attorney generalâ€™s office did not respond to emailed requests for comment. ExxonMobil did not return calls seeking comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nIn April, Mike Cousins, ExxonMobilâ€™s senior vice president of exploration and new ventures, said in a statement that making progress on the companyâ€™s plans in Guyana was â€œvitalâ€ to unlock value from offshore resources for the countryâ€™s people.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said last month the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\n\"There is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,\" he added.

We are standing up for ourselves, standing up for our country, standing up for our region and standing up for the planet,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nGuyanaâ€™s ministry of natural resources and the attorney generalâ€™s office did not respond to emailed requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe oil consortium led by ExxonMobil, which includes partners Hess Corp and the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC-Nexen), has so far made 18 discoveries, containing about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, in Guyanaâ€™s Stabroek block, one of the worldâ€™s largest reserves.\r\n\r\nAn ExxonMobil spokesman said by email that the company in Guyana complies â€œwith all applicable laws at every step of the exploration, appraisal, development and production stagesâ€.\r\n\r\nAssessments for each of Exxonâ€™s projects in Guyana â€œoutline potential environmental impacts and mitigationsâ€, he added.\r\n\r\nVickram Bharrat, Guyanaâ€™s minister of natural resources, said in April the government was committed to the â€œsustainable developmentâ€ of its oil and gas resources â€œto enhance the lives of all Guyaneseâ€.\r\n\r\nOil production is expected to generate tens of billions of dollars over the years in much-needed revenue for the nation with a population of about 740,000.\r\n\r\nCarroll Muffett, head of the Washington-based nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law, said the Guyana legal case would help â€œequip and support other people across this region who are fighting similar developmentâ€ of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are seeing a rapid evolution in the law and the foundations of each case become progressively much stronger,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nâ€˜EFFECTIVEâ€™ TOOL\r\n\r\nFossil fuel companies face growing pressure as activists go to court to hold businesses and governments accountable for the climate change impacts of their operations.\r\n\r\nLegal cases have aimed to force governments to shift away from coal, oil and gas, and rapidly increase investment in renewable energy, as well as boost national emissions reduction targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\r\n\r\nLast week, a ruling by a Dutch court against Royal Dutch Shell ordered the energy giant to reduce its planet-warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels. Shell said it would appeal the decision.\r\n\r\nDennis van Berkel, legal counsel for the Urgenda Foundation, a Dutch environmental group, said the ruling was â€œgroundbreakingâ€, showing that litigation is proving to be one of the â€œmost effective toolsâ€ to force action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œHuman rights and constitutional obligations still primarily rest on the state,â€ he said. â€œHowever fossil fuel companies will see that they canâ€™t get away with just saying, â€˜well, we are doing what the law requires (of) usâ€™.â€\r\n\r\nSam Hunter Jones, a lawyer with environmental law charity ClientEarth, said climate litigation worldwide looks set to focus more on the impacts on human rights as â€œfossil fuel investments are being challenged and scrutinizedâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe expect to see these kinds of principles used and developed further in cases brought before courts across the world,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nREGULATION ROLLBACK\r\n\r\nSuch principles are already well-established in Latin America, where a large share of countries have constitutions and regulations that recognize the right of citizens to a healthy environment and the rights of nature like rivers and ecosystems.\r\n\r\nCaio Borges, coordinator of the law and climate program at the Brazil-based Institute for Climate and Society, said many South American countries already â€œhave really good laws and environmental safeguardsâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, thereâ€™s a big gap and mismatch between the formal legal rules and the on-the-ground enforcement of these rules,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nClimate cases in Latin America have often been brought forward by indigenous peoples against the state for failing to protect the environment, including the carbon-storing Amazon rainforest spread across eight countries in the region.\r\n\r\nBorges said he expected an increase in litigation as citizens put more pressure on governments to curb rising deforestation and accelerate action on climate change.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn Brazil and in other countries of the Amazon, these cases will mainly be focused on land use,â€ he said. â€œ(They) will discuss how the preservation of the forest is essential for the achievement of climate commitment goals.â€\r\n\r\nHe predicted growth in climate litigation against governments and companies in resource-rich countries like Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil that rely on mining and oil revenues, with youth activists playing a bigger role.\r\n\r\nWhile climate cases in Latin America have so far mainly focused on holding governments to account, one Peruvian farmer has taken on German utility company RWE.\r\n\r\nSaul Luciano Lliuya, from the town of Huaraz under the Palcaraju glacier that is pushing the waters of Lake Palcacocha higher, sued RWE in 2015 over its role in fuelling global warming.\r\n\r\nLliuya has argued that greenhouse gas emissions from RWEâ€™s coal-fired power plants are partly to blame for melting the glacier, producing water that threatens to flood his home.\r\n\r\nIn some Latin American countries, in particular Brazil, attempts are underway to weaken environmental regulation, Borges said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is now a movement (across the region), which involves both state and corporate actors, lobbying governments to reduce the level of protection ... so a lot of this litigation is to seek the enforcement of existing rules,â€ he added.', 0),

(232, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Independent third-party audits (Y / N/ no data)', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK (AP) â€” ExxonMobil is facing a major challenge from a group of investors in one of the biggest fights a corporate boardroom has endured over its stance on climate change, an issue of rising urgency for many shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe investor group is pushing to replace four of the oil giantâ€™s board members with executives they say are better suited to both strengthen the companyâ€™s finances and lead it through the transition to cleaner energy. The fight represents a moment of reckoning for major publicly traded companies to address a global crisis.\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1, the name of the hedge fund that has mounted the challenge, owns just a sliver of Exxonâ€™s shares. But the dissident slate of board members it has put forward commands the backing of some of the countryâ€™s most powerful institutional investors, including the largest public pension funds.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the outcome of the shareholder vote, to be announced after the annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, the challenge reflects momentum among consumers, investors and government leaders around the globe to pivot away from fossil fuels and invest in a future where energy needs are increasingly met using renewable sources. To that end, President Joe Biden has set the ambitious goal of slashing Americaâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re at a tipping point,â€ said Aeisha Mastagni, portfolio manager at the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, one of the nationâ€™s largest pension funds and among the major institutional investors that backed the alternative group of directors. â€œYouâ€™re seeing investors from all around the world that are wanting to see better disclosure around climate change risk, youâ€™re seeing shareholder proposals that are passing with increased shareholder support, and now we have this monumental vote at ExxonMobil.â€\r\n\r\nEngine No. 1 wants Exxon to refresh its board with directors who have a track record of managing change in the energy sector. The group asserts that Exxon has under-performed compared with its peers, having lost market value even when demand for oil and gas was growing. It also argues that the company lacks a credible strategy to create value in a de-carbonizing world and that its board lacks people with experience in successfully revamping an energy giant.\r\n\r\nIn opposing the challenge, Exxon counters that it has continually refreshed its board with directors who have expertise in energy, capital allocation and transitions. It contends that the company has been investing in low-carbon solutions, including a recent proposal to transform the Houston Ship Channel into a hub for carbon capture and sequestration. That technology, still under development, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of the air and storing it underground off shore.\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT\r\n\r\nIn that proposal, Exxon called on government and industry to together invest $100 billion. Exxon has said it would spend $3 billion through 2025 on carbon capture and other low-carbon initiatives.\r\n\r\nThose efforts have fallen short of the demands of Exxonâ€™s dissident investor groups. Other major oil companies, from British Petroleum and Shell to Conoco Phillips and Chevron, have done more to satisfy shareholders. Investors want more corporate disclosures of climate-damaging emissions, and they expect energy companies to diversify their portfolios to include more renewable sources, said Anne Simpson, managing investment director for board governance and sustainability at the California Public Employeesâ€™ Retirement System â€” known as CalPERS â€” Americaâ€™s largest pension fund.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat weâ€™re finding with other oil companies,â€ Simpson said, â€œis weâ€™re making progress, and Exxon needs to catch up. Exxon is still saying one thing and doing another.â€\r\n\r\nCalPERS, a heavyweight in the investing community, voted for Engine No. 1â€²s slate of candidates. The pension fund asserts that through its engagement and proxy voting, it has compelled hundreds of companies to add new directors to their boards.\r\n\r\nâ€œUsually what happens is, we have a collaborative approach where we work with companies,â€ Simpson said. â€œI would say itâ€™s in rare circumstances that investors feel the need to actually put their own candidates forward. But that is because the nominating committee hasnâ€™t been able to fulfill investorsâ€™ expectations. Exxon has had several years attempting to address this issue.â€\r\n\r\nSupport for shareholder proposals that focus on climate change is rapidly growing. In 2015, Glass Lewis, a firm that advises institutional investors, reviewed 14 shareholder proposals that requested additional disclosures on climate-related issues, such as the companiesâ€™ levels of greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nBy 2017, there were 21 such shareholder proposals that went to a vote; three of them received over 50% approval. Before then, none had received majority support, according to Glass Lewis.\r\n\r\nThis year, 25 climate-related shareholder proposals have made it onto ballots, and those that have been voted on so far have received support from 59% of shareholders on average, according to the Institute for Shareholder Services.\r\n\r\nThe International Energy Agency this month warned that immediate action was needed to reshape the worldâ€™s energy sector, and it recommended ending investments in new oil and gas wells and coal mines.\r\n\r\nâ€œEven if you love fossil fuels, you have to acknowledge that theyâ€™re not making any more of them, and any company that wants to be sustainable over the long term has got to figure out what their next step is going to be,â€ said Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, an influential figure in corporate governance who voted in support of Engine No. 1. â€œThereâ€™s a massive demographic shift. I think the millennial generation and the generation that follow are much, much more sensitive on these issues as employees, as consumers and as investors, than the generations that have gone before.â€\r\n\r\nThe nationâ€™s most influential proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Egan Jones, also backed most or all of the candidates proposed by Engine No. 1. The proxy advisory firms conduct research and advise institutional shareholders on how to vote on such matters.\r\n\r\nAlso backing the alternate slate of directors was the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which argued that Exxon has failed to properly manage its exposure to climate risks.\r\n\r\nSome experts say the pressure from Engine No. 1 and other shareholders appears to be making a difference at Exxon. The companyâ€™s carbon sequestration proposal was not a major part of the conversation at Exxon a few years ago, but now management is talking about committing $3 billion to low-carbon ventures, said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA.\r\n\r\nâ€œClimate change and carbon is capturing more dollars tied to that than anything else,â€ Glickman said. â€œSo the writing is on the wall that more money is shifting in this direction.â€\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nAssociated Press Writer Stan Choe contributed to this report.', 0);

They approached Mr McCoy, who agreed to speak over Zoom.\r\n\r\nDuring the covert recordings, which have been passed to Channel 4 News, Mr McCoy claims:\r\n\r\nthe company secretly fought against legislative action on climate change using third-party organisations\r\n\r\nhe lobbied key senators to remove and/or diminish climate change measures from President Bidenâ€™s US $2 trillion infrastructure and jobs bill as it proceeds through the legislative process\r\n\r\nhe regards trade bodies like the American Petroleum Institute as â€œwhipping boysâ€ in order to avoid public scrutiny on Capitol Hill\r\n\r\nDuring the virtual meeting held on 7 May, the investigators asked Mr McCoy questions about ExxonMobilâ€™s current and historical lobbying on environmental issues.\r\n\r\nIn the excerpts from the footage to be broadcast on Channel 4 News tonight, Mr McCoy claims that ExxonMobil has aggressively fought science to deny climate change in order to maximise profit and shareholder return. He alleges that ExxonMobil joined â€œshadow groupsâ€ to pursue climate change denial.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy said: â€œDid we aggressively fight against some of the science? Yes. Did we hide our science? Absolutely not. Did we join some of these shadow groups to work against some of the early efforts? Yes, thatâ€™s true. But thereâ€™s nothing, thereâ€™s nothing illegal about that.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe were looking out for our investments. We were looking out for our shareholders.â€\r\n\r\nExxonMobil told Channel 4 News that they â€œhave supported climate science for decades.â€\r\n\r\nâ€˜Itâ€™s like fishingâ€™\r\n\r\nMr McCoy likens the approach to lobbying congressmen to the way fishermen target fish, claiming that ExxonMobil puts out â€œbaitâ€ and then â€œreels inâ€ congressmen on issues like carbon tax, electric vehicles, chemicals, taxation and infrastructure.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy said: â€œWhen you have an opportunity to talk to a member of Congress, I liken it to fishing, right? You know you have bait, you throw that bait out. And they say: â€˜Oh, you want to talk about infrastructure, yeah.â€™\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd then you start to reel them in and you start to have these conversations about federal leasing programmes, you start to have these conversations about a carbon tax. You know, itâ€™s all these opportunities that you use and to use the fishing analogy again just to kind of reel them in.â€\r\n\r\nHe added: â€œI make sure I get them the right information that they need so they look good. And then they help me out. Theyâ€™re a captive audience. They know they need you. And I need them.â€\r\n\r\nHe says lobbyists aim to have a direct relationship with a member of congress, adding: â€œYou want to be able to go to the chiefâ€¦ and say we need congressman so and so to be able to either introduce this bill, we need him to make a floor statement, we need him to send a letter. You name it, weâ€™ve asked for everything.â€\r\n\r\nâ€˜The Kingmakerâ€™\r\n\r\nMr McCoy names 11 senators who he says are â€œcrucialâ€ to ExxonMobil: Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Senator Joe Manchin, Senator Kyrsten Sinema, Senator Jon Tester, Senator Maggie Hassan, Senator John Barrasso, Senator John Cornyn, Senator Steve Daines, Senator Chris Coons, Senator Mark Kelly and Senator Marco Rubio\r\n\r\nWe gave all these senators a chance to respond. All the senators declined to comment. There is no suggestion of illegality.\r\n\r\nChannel 4 News has established, through Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, that all except two of these senators (Senators Maggie Hassan and Mark Kelly) have received financial contributions from ExxonMobil.\r\n\r\nExxonMobil insists â€œour lobbying efforts fully comply with all laws and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basisâ€.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy described Senator Joe Manchin as â€œthe Kingmakerâ€ in the Senate and he says he spoke to his office on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nThe FEC data shows Senator Manchin has received at least $12,500 from the ExxonMobil Political Action Committee in declared disbursements since the beginning of the 2011-12 election cycle.\r\n\r\nMr McCoy described how a â€œbig piece of [his] job is education and advocacyâ€ and says that in his work on behalf of ExxonMobil he argues that US government programmes to roll out electric vehicles are unrealistic.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œThe research and development conversation has taken us a long way because of climate change. And there is a struggle to find solutions and to get the reductions that theyâ€™re looking for. And youâ€™re not going to be able to just switch to battery operated vehicles or wind for your electricity. And just having that conversation around why thatâ€™s not possible in the next 10 years is critically important to the work that we do.â€\r\n\r\nâ€˜Whipping boyâ€™\r\n\r\nMr McCoy described a lobbying strategy in which he claims ExxonMobil uses third parties to mask its interests from public view and accountability.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œWe donâ€™t want it to be us, to have these conversations, especially in a hearing. Itâ€™s getting our associations to step in and have those conversations and answer those tough questions and be for, the lack of a better term, the whipping boy for some of these members of congress.â€\r\n\r\nHe added: â€œThere was something we were working on earlier this week where we, where our CEO was invited to a hearing from a member of congress who we know is just going to rip him to shreds when he goes there. So, we look at it and we say: well, why us?â€\r\n\r\nMr McCoy claims that ExxonMobil lobbied Congress to dilute the climate provisions of President Bidenâ€™s Infrastructure Bill.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œThatâ€™s a completely different conversation when you start to stick to roads and bridges. And instead of a $2 trillion bill, itâ€™s an $800 billion dollar bill. If you lower that threshold, you stick to highways and bridges then a lot of the negative stuff starts to come out.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œWhy would you put in something on emissions reductions on climate change to oil refineries in a highway bill? So, people say yeah that doesnâ€™t make any sense, so then you get to the germane of saying that shouldnâ€™t be in this bill.â€\r\n\r\nExxonMobil said: â€œOur discussion on the bill are not accurately portrayed. Our lobbying efforts are related to a tax burden that could disadvantage us businesses.â€\r\n\r\nCarbon tax\r\n\r\nMr McCoy appears to suggest that ExxonMobilâ€™s public support for a carbon tax is underpinned by the conviction it will never happen, allowing the company to â€œsupportâ€ it in order to appear green.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œI will tell you there is not an appetite for a carbon tax. It is a non-starter. Nobody is going to propose a tax on all Americans. And the cynical side of me says yeah we kind of know that. But it gives us a talking point. We can say well what is ExxonMobil for? Well weâ€™re for a carbon tax.\r\n\r\nâ€œCarbon tax is not gonna happen. I have always said, and Iâ€™ve worked on climate change issues for twenty years. Thereâ€™s a lot of talk around it and the bottom line is itâ€™s going to take political courage, political will in order to get something done. And that just doesnâ€™t exist in politics. It just doesnâ€™t.\r\n\r\nPurporting to speak on behalf of ExxonMobil, Mr McCoy also expressed a corporate view that, contrary to science, natural gas is a clean energy source.\r\n\r\nHe said: â€œOn a clean electricity standard, we think natural gas will play a key role in anything. And not just as a bridge fuel. We think it is a low emission energy source and should be part of a clean electricity standard.â€\r\n\r\nExxonMobil statement\r\n\r\nA spokesperson for ExxonMobil told Channel 4 News: â€œGreenpeace has waged a multi-decade campaign against our company and industry, which has included false claims and unlawful actions at our facilities as well as those of other companies around the world.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur lobbying efforts are related to a tax burden that could disadvantage U.S. businesses, and we have made that position known publicly. ExxonMobil stands by our position that increased taxes on American businesses make the U.S. less competitive.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have been clear in supporting an efficient, economy-wide price on carbon as the best way to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. While there is not broad support for a tax, we are actively and publicly discussing other options, including lower-carbon fuels and other sector-based approaches that would place a uniform, predictable cost on carbon.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have supported climate science for decades. Greenpeace and others have distorted our position on climate science and our support for effective policy solutions.\r\n\r\nâ€ExxonMobil transparently engages with a variety of trade associations, think tanks and coalitions in order to promote informed dialogue and sound public policy in areas pertinent to the Corporationâ€™s interests.\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil exercises its right to engage in lobbying in the United States at both the Federal and State levels to advocate our positions on issues that affect our Corporation and the energy industry.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe have a responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to represent their interests in public policy discussions that impact our business.\r\n\r\nâ€œOur lobbying efforts fully comply with all laws and are publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis, including the issues we discuss.â€', 0),

Sign Up\r\n\r\nExxonMobil activist investor Engine No. 1 expanded its presence on the oil giantâ€™s board to three seats, according to preliminary vote tallies, cementing a victory that has reverberated across the energy industry.\r\n\r\nThe initial counts show the newest nominee from Engine No. 1â€™s slate elected to ExxonMobilâ€™s 12-member board is private-equity investor Alexander Karsner, ExxonMobil said Wednesday in a statement. The results, which still need to be certified, confirmed an earlier report by Bloomberg News.\r\n\r\nThe outcome is a coup for Engine No. 1, a new and previously unproven player in the realm of activist investing, which, despite holding a miniscule stake in Exxon, eventually amassed broad support from major institutional holders following a six-month proxy fight.\r\n\r\nKarsner joins Gregory Goff, former chief executive officer of refiner Andeavor, and environmental scientist Kaisa Hietala, whose victories were announced last week shortly after Exxonâ€™s May 26 annual general meeting. The voting also shows investors rejected Wan Zulkiflee, a former oil executive who leaves the board just four months after Exxon appointed him.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, shareholders went against Exxon and supported the disclosure of political- and climate-lobbying activities. While the votes on those two proposals are non-binding, they represent another remarkable reversal for Exxon, which has previously faced down most investor motions seeking environmental and corporate-governance changes.\r\n\r\nThe Western worldâ€™s biggest oil company managed to place nine of its nominees onto the board. Chairman and chief executive Darren Woods captured about 2.67 million votes, placing him in the bottom half of the field. Lead director Ken Frazier fared only marginally better with a seventh-place showing.\r\n\r\nA third seat for Engine No. 1 caps a months-long proxy fight and provides a coda to last weekâ€™s dramatic meeting, which at one point was halted so that the company could have more time to count the votes.\r\n\r\nThe shift in Exxonâ€™s boardroom may present a crippling blow to the future leadership of Woods, according to Ceres, a coalition of environmentally active investors managing $37 trillion. Woods told shareholders earlier last month that voting for the dissident directors would â€œderail our progress and jeopardise your dividend.â€\r\n\r\nOn the proposal to report on Exxonâ€™s climate lobbying efforts, almost two-thirds of votes cast were in favor of the measure.\r\n\r\nInvestor dissatisfaction with Exxon has largely centered on two issues that are becoming more interlinked: climate change and financial performance. The oil titan envisages a profitable, long-term future for fossil fuels, and sees no point in investing in traditional renewable energy businesses. It also refuses to commit to targets to zero out emissions, unlike European rivals.\r\n\r\nIn some respects Exxon is in a better position than at the start of the year. Its stock has rallied more than 45% this year as oil prices rebound and pandemic lockdowns ease.

BPâ€™s rival Shell is also pulling out of all of its operations in Russia, as are U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil and Norwayâ€™s state-controlled company, Equinor.\r\n\r\nThese breakups will not be cheap. BPâ€™s stake in Rosneft is worth US$14 billion. In various projects, Shell has about $3 billion in assets in Russia. ExxonMobil has over 1,000 employees and more than $4 billion in assets there. Pulling out will inflict significant financial hits on all of these companies.\r\n\r\nWestern energy companies have invested and operated in Russia for a long time â€“ over 30 years for BP and more than 25 years for ExxonMobil. They are accustomed to managing international political risks.\r\n\r\nIn my view, Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has completely changed Western energy companiesâ€™ cost-benefit analysis of doing business in Russia. I have researched multinational companiesâ€™ foreign direct investments in emerging markets for over two decades and have closely followed Western energy companiesâ€™ investments in Russia. I expect that other Western oil majors, such as French company TotalEnergies, are also likely to pull out of Russia, and that it may take many years for these companies to reengage there.\r\n\r\nBig risks, big payoffs\r\n\r\nForeign investment in Russia has never been easy. For example, in 2003, BP and a consortium of Russian oligarchs formed the joint venture TNK-BP, which became one of the largest oil producers in Russia. However, disputes ensued over the ventureâ€™s leadership, operations and international expansion.\r\n\r\nThe situation became so fraught that Bob Dudley, then the head of TNK-BP and later BPâ€™s chief executive officer, was forced to flee from Russia in 2008. To resolve the disputes, BP sold its 50% equity in TNK-BP to Rosneft in 2013 for $12.5 billion in cash and a nearly 20% share in Rosneft.\r\n\r\nShell got involved in the early 1990s in the Sakhalin-2 project to develop natural gas reserves in Russiaâ€™s Far East, and built Russiaâ€™s first liquefied natural gas facility there. As the project neared completion in 2006, at a cost of more than $20 billion, Shell and its Japanese partners were forced to sell a 50% share to Russiaâ€™s state-owned natural gas giant, Gazprom, for $7.45 billion because Putinâ€™s government was unhappy with the easy terms previously offered by the Yeltsin administration.\r\n\r\nDuring crises like these, Western energy companies weighed the potential gains and costs of operating in Russia and concluded that staying in was worth it. Itâ€™s easy to see why: Russia holds 24% of the worldâ€™s total natural gas reserves. It has comprehensive pipeline networks to the west to move natural gas to European countries, and large reserves to its east that are close to some of the worldâ€™s hungriest energy markets, including Japan, South Korea and China.\r\n\r\nFor years, Western energy companies viewed compromise with the Russian government as part of the cost of doing business there. As long as expected gains exceeded costs, they stayed.\r\n\r\nReputations matter\r\n\r\nRussiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine has changed those calculations. Now, executives at oil majors need to assess possible broader damage to their corporate reputations and to relationships with their home country governments, shareholders and other interest groups if they stay in Russia. Unlike controversies within the energy industry, invading an independent sovereign nation is much too high profile of a development for companies to ignore.\r\n\r\nAcademic research shows that there is a positive correlation between companiesâ€™ socially responsible behaviors and financial performance. Simply put, companies that do good tend to do well financially. The invasion of Ukraine represents a critical shift in Russiaâ€™s business environment. As BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney stated on Feb. 26, the situation unfolding in Ukraine â€œhas caused us to fundamentally rethink BPâ€™s position with Rosneft.â€\r\n\r\nIn particular, Western energy companies that partner with the Russian government now may be perceived as weakening their own governmentsâ€™ sanctions and helping to finance Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine. Russia owns 40% of BPâ€™s Russian partner, Rosneft; the companyâ€™s CEO and board chair, Igor Sechin, is Russiaâ€™s former deputy prime minister and a close Putin ally. Shellâ€™s primary partner in Russia is Gazprom, the state-run natural gas giant.\r\n\r\nTo maintain their corporate reputations and relationships with key interest groups, BP, Shell, Equinor and ExxonMobil clearly have decided that it is important to cut their ties in Russia completely, immediately and publicly. BPâ€™s current and former chief executive officers resigned from Rosneftâ€™s board of directors on Feb. 27, three days after the invasion began, â€œwith immediate effect.â€\r\n\r\nWhile the Western world is imposing severe and united sanctions on Russia in sectors ranging from finance to aviation, Western governments have avoided sanctioning energy exports from Russia, seeking to protect their citizens from price spikes. Nonetheless, if Western energy companies remain in Russia and continue partnering with Russian state-owned companies, they could be perceived as undermining the Western response. Indeed, BPâ€™s exit decision reportedly came under pressure from the British government.\r\n\r\nNone of these companies have many viable potential buyers for their Russian holdings. Russian firms, facing sanctions, donâ€™t have the resources to acquire foreign investorsâ€™ assets, and other Western energy companies are unlikely to pursue them. The only potential investors are private equity firms that face less scrutiny than publicly traded companies, or companies from countries that donâ€™t join Western sanctions on Russia.\r\n\r\nRussiaâ€™s energy sector depends heavily upon Western companiesâ€™ technologies, especially for hard-to-recover oil projects and offshore projects. BP, Shell and ExxonMobil will leave significant technological voids that could be hard for newcomers to fill.\r\n\r\nCorporate leaders are used to making high-level strategic decisions that require weighing costs and benefits. What has changed the calculus for Western energy companies is the broad potential damage to their companiesâ€™ reputations and relationships with various interest groups if they stay in Russia. Clearly, executives cannot limit benefit-cost calculations to specific investments. Their overall corporate reputations can be worth billions of dollars.\r\n\r\n[Youâ€™re smart and curious about the world. So are The Conversationâ€™s authors and editors.

(241, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'Independent Audit report (Y / N / no data)', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

REUTERS/Sergio Moraes\r\n\r\nLast Thursday, the Church Commissioners for England joined growing investor campaigns to demand changes at Exxon and backed calls for a board refresh and development of a strategy for the largest U.S. oil companyâ€™s transition to cleaner fuels.\r\n\r\nSeveral of Exxonâ€™s rivals this year have set longer-term climate ambitions, including Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc, which aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nExxon said it would start reporting so-called Scope 3 emissions in 2021, a large category of greenhouse gases emitted from fuels and products it sells to customers, such as jet fuel and gasoline.\r\n\r\nBy 2025, Exxon would reduce the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse gas emissions by 15% to 20% from 2016 levels. It did not set an overall emissions target, however, and reducing intensity means that emissions still could rise if oil and gas output grows.\r\n\r\nThe reduction would be supported by a 40%-50% decrease in methane intensity and a 35%-45% decrease in flaring intensity across Exxonâ€™s global operations, with routine natural gas flaring eliminated within a decade, the company said.\r\n\r\nSince the 2015 Paris climate accord set a goal of keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), pressure from investors has increased and some of Exxonâ€™s peers have agreed on more ambitious targets. Exxon said its goals were in line with the Paris accord, which the United States exited under President Donald Trump but that President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rejoin.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe certainly recognize the direction of travel that Paris sets out and the ambitions for society to get to net zero as early as possible before the end of the century,â€ Peter Trelenberg, ExxonMobil director of greenhouse gas and climate change, told a news conference on Monday.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we have tried to do is to develop specific actionable plans that we can hold our organization accountable to drive continuous improvement in emissions.â€\r\n\r\nFurther goals would be set as the 2025 targets are met, Trelenberg said.\r\n\r\nâ€˜NOTABLE TURNâ€™\r\n\r\nThe targets are â€œencouraging news and doubtless a response in part to expanding shareholder pressure,â€ said Timothy Smith, director of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) shareowner engagement at Boston Trust Walden Co, which has backed several shareholder proposals seeking improved disclosure at Exxon and other companies.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey had long opposed detailing Scope 3 emissions, so this is a notable turn for them. And Exxon is known for its strength in managing policy pledges it makes.â€\r\n\r\nThe new targets do not address product emissions, a â€œmain source of risk,â€ said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at sustainability nonprofit Ceres. â€œAt a time when even U.S. peers like Occidental and ConocoPhillips have set net-zero targets for their operational emissions and committed to addressing their product emissions, this effort from Exxon falls short.â€\r\n\r\nExxon said it would meet goals it set in 2018 by the end of this year to cut methane emissions by 15% and flaring by 25% compared with 2016 levels.\r\n\r\nLast week, Engine No. 1, a $250 million California-based firm, called for expanded spending and pay cuts at Exxon, a board shake-up and a shift to cleaner fuels. Its views were supported at least in part by the California State Teachersâ€™ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and hedge fund D.E.

REUTERS/Ricardo Rojas\r\n\r\nSingle-use plastic consumption has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO. Face masks and latex gloves are washing up daily on Asiaâ€™s remote beaches. Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging.\r\n\r\nThe new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%.\r\n\r\nThe roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study.\r\n\r\nIf no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.\r\n\r\nâ€œPlastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isnâ€™t a â€˜your problem and not my problemâ€™. Itâ€™s not one countryâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s everyoneâ€™s problem,â€ said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s going to get worse if we donâ€™t do anything.â€\r\n\r\nThe strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.\r\n\r\nThis would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.\r\n\r\nOIL AND SODA\r\n\r\nThe amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.\r\n\r\nBig plastic makers, including ExxonMobil, Dow and Chevron Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.\r\n\r\nThe paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.\r\n\r\nSome of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever. They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.\r\n\r\nBut current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.\r\n\r\nTo cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.\r\n\r\nSome criticised the studyâ€™s inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production.\r\n\r\nInstead, â€œwe would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,â€ said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nâ€œIf industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.â€', 0),

REUTERS/Jim Young\r\n\r\nThe talks between the energy majors also involve the Mozambican government, according to the sources, as it has to give final approval to any new agreement.\r\n\r\nThe field that straddles the projects happens to contain gas that is thicker and therefore cheaper to extract and convert into LNG than reserves elsewhere in the projects.\r\n\r\nThe volume each project could extract from the shared area was set out in a 2015 â€œunitisationâ€ - or resource-sharing - agreement. However both U.S. major Exxon and Franceâ€™s Total are now renegotiating that contract with each other, the sources said.\r\n\r\nThe companies are looking to cut costs wherever they can, bruised by a COVID-19-induced collapse in global oil and gas prices and facing a worsening security situation in Mozambique.\r\n\r\nAcross the industry, most companies have been forced to delay decisions on new LNG projects and write down investments in existing production plants, in stark contrast to last yearâ€™s record level of approvals for plants.\r\n\r\nSuccess in the talks could be particularly important for Exxon, which still has to woo investors ahead of a delayed final investment decision (FID) on its $30 billion Rovuma LNG project, which the sources now donâ€™t expect until early 2022.\r\n\r\nThe FID on Totalâ€™s $20 billion Mozambique LNG project was made in June 2019.\r\n\r\nThe current contract was signed by Eni and Anadarko. In 2017 Eni sold a stake in the Rovuma venture to Exxon, which is now the project operator, while Anadarko sold Mozambique LNG to Total last year.\r\n\r\nIt allows the projects to extract a combined 24 trillion cubic feet of gas from the â€œstraddlingâ€ reserves, with a 50/50 share in phase one of development.\r\n\r\nNow Exxon and Total are trying to rework the agreement to increase extraction from the straddling reserves as a way to boost efficiency and increase their projectsâ€™ annual LNG production, according to the sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey want to use the cheapest gas first - which is the straddling resources,â€ said one of the sources.\r\n\r\nAsked about the negotiations, an Exxon spokesman said: â€œAs a matter of practice, we do not comment on third-party rumour or speculation.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œExxonMobil continues to actively work with its partners and the government to optimise development plans by improving synergies and exploring opportunities related to the current lower-cost environment,â€ he added.\r\n\r\nTotal said the operators of the two projects â€œcontinue working together to maximize synergies and optimise future phases of developmentâ€.\r\n\r\nMozambiqueâ€™s state oil and gas company ENH, which owns 10% of Rovuma LNG, and 15% of Mozambique LNG, referred Reutersâ€™ questions to the National Petroleum Institute (INP), the body that manages the nationâ€™s energy development.\r\n\r\nThe INP did not provide answers to Reuters questions.\r\n\r\nBOOSTING PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nA Standard Bank study from 2019 said Exxonâ€™s Rovuma LNG would use 15.1 Tcf of straddling gas reserves, above the unitisation cap as it included gas reserved for domestic use and condensate, plus 6.4 Tcf of non-straddling reserves - to produce 15.2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG.\r\n\r\nInstead, the source said, Exxon wants to extract only gas from the straddling reserves, increasing the amount it can access from the shared area to around 20.1 Tcf, which would result in 7.9% higher production, at 16.4 MTPA, and lower unit costs.\r\n\r\nThis would mark a considerable efficiency gain for Rovumaâ€™s phase one, projected by Exxon to last 25 years.\r\n\r\nMozambique LNG expects to produce the first LNG in 2024, delivering 12.88 MTPA of LNG in its first phase.\r\n\r\nReuters was not able to establish what Total wanted to change its straddling gas and LNG production figures to.\r\n\r\nA fourth source said the two companies had been in talks for some time about how to cut costs and generate synergies at their projects, and confirmed Exxon was looking to increase annual LNG output.\r\n\r\nIn April, Exxon delayed its FID on the Rovuma project, which had been expected this year, as it prepared to make cuts to capital expenditure across its business amid diving oil prices.\r\n\r\nThe Mozambique government has said it expects Exxonâ€™s FID next year, but all four sources said it may instead come in early 2022, in line with estimates from Oslo-based research house Rystad Energy which put it at 2022 or 2023.\r\n\r\nIn response to questions about whether the FID could be pushed to 2022 or 2023, Exxon said: â€œWe continue to work closely with the Area 4 partners, as Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop.â€\r\n\r\nArea 4 is the name given to Rovuma LNGâ€™s licence area.\r\n\r\nSHADOW OF INSURGENCY\r\n\r\nWhile Mozambique is impatient for the final investment decision to be taken, there could be advantages for Exxon in pushing it out to 2023.\r\n\r\nIt would mean the company wouldnâ€™t produce its first LNG from the project until around 2028, giving more time for demand to bounce back after the drop caused by the pandemic.\r\n\r\nHowever the plans are being laid under the shadow of an insurgency on the projectsâ€™ doorstep. The security situation has worsened this year and the group, which has links to Islamic State, has seized and held strategic locations including a town just 60 km from the gas developments.\r\n\r\nAnalysts warn the groupâ€™s capability to strike the projects themselves is increasing, though it is still unlikely.\r\n\r\nOne of the sources, a Mozambican gas industry official, said the insurgency was a major threat to the oil majors.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe investment will not be viable without security,â€ the official said.', 0),

(249, 'ExxonMobil', 'www.reuters.com', 'https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-plastic-recycling-spe-idUSKBN26Q1LO', '2020-10-05 11:13:20', NULL, NULL, 'External Initiatives', 'Special Report: Plastic pandemic - COVID-19 trashed the recycling dream', '(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has sparked a rush for plastic.\r\n\r\nFrom Wuhan to New York, demand for face shields, gloves, takeaway food containers and bubble wrap for online shopping has surged. Since most of that cannot be recycled, so has the waste.\r\n\r\nBut there is another consequence. The pandemic has intensified a price war between recycled and new plastic, made by the oil industry. Itâ€™s a war recyclers worldwide are losing, price data and interviews with more than two dozen businesses across five continents show.\r\n\r\nâ€œI really see a lot of people struggling,â€ Steve Wong, CEO of Hong-Kong based Fukutomi Recycling and chairman of the China Scrap Plastics Association told Reuters in an interview. â€œThey donâ€™t see a light at the end of the tunnel.â€\r\n\r\nThe reason: Nearly every piece of plastic begins life as a fossil fuel. The economic slowdown has punctured demand for oil. In turn, that has cut the price of new plastic.\r\n\r\nAlready since 1950, the world has created 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste, 91% of which has never been recycled, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Science. Most is hard to recycle, and many recyclers have long depended on government support. New plastic, known to the industry as â€œvirginâ€ material, can be half the price of the most common recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nSince COVID-19, even drinks bottles made of recycled plastic â€“ the most commonly recycled plastic item â€“ have become less viable. The recycled plastic to make them is 83% to 93% more expensive than new bottle-grade plastic, according to market analysts at the Independent Commodity Intelligence Services (ICIS).\r\n\r\nThe pandemic hit as politicians in many countries promised to wage war on waste from single-use plastics. China, which used to import more than half the worldâ€™s traded plastic waste, banned imports of most of it in 2018. The European Union plans to ban many single-use plastic items from 2021. The U.S. Senate is considering a ban on single-use plastic and may introduce legal recycling targets.\r\n\r\nPlastic, most of which does not decompose, is a significant driver of climate change.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of four plastic bottles alone releases the equivalent greenhouse gas emissions of driving one mile in a car, according to the World Economic Forum, based on a study by the drinks industry. The United States burns six times more plastic than it recycles, according to research in April 2019 by Jan Dell, a chemical engineer and former vice chair of the U.S. Federal climate committee.\r\n\r\nBut the coronavirus has accentuated a trend to create more, not less, plastic trash.\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas industry plans to spend around $400 billion over the next five years on plants to make raw materials for virgin plastic, according to a study in September by Carbon Tracker, an energy think tank.\r\n\r\nThis is because, as a growing fleet of electric vehicles and improved engine efficiency reduce fuel demand, the industry hopes rising demand for new plastic can assure future growth in demand for oil and gas. It is counting on soaring use of plastic-based consumer goods by millions of new middle-class consumers in Asia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the next few decades, population and income growth are expected to create more demand for plastics, which help support safety, convenience and improved living standards,â€ ExxonMobil spokeswoman Sarah Nordin told Reuters.\r\n\r\nMost companies say they share concerns about plastic waste and are supporting efforts to reduce it. However, their investments in these efforts are a fraction of those going into making new plastic, Reuters found.\r\n\r\nReuters surveyed 12 of the largest oil and chemicals firms globally â€“ BASF, Chevron, Dow, Exxon, Formosa Plastics, INEOS, LG Chem, LyondellBasell, Mitsubishi Chemical, SABIC, Shell and Sinopec. Only a handful gave details of how much they are investing in waste reduction. Three declined to comment in detail or did not respond.\r\n\r\nMost said they channel their efforts through a group called the Alliance to End Plastic Waste, which is also backed by consumer goods companies, and which has pledged $1.5 billion over the next five years on that effort. Its 47 members, most of whom are in the plastics industry, had combined annual revenue of almost $2.5 trillion last year, according to a Reuters tally of company results.\r\n\r\nIn total, commitments by the Alliance and the companies surveyed amounted to less than $2 billion over five years, or $400 million a year, the Reuters survey found. Thatâ€™s a fraction of their sales.\r\n\r\nPlans to invest so heavily in new plastic are â€œquite a concerning move,â€ said Lisa Beauvilain, Head of Sustainability at Impax Asset Management, a fund with $18.5 billion under management.\r\n\r\nâ€œCountries with often undeveloped waste management and recycling infrastructure will be ill-equipped to handle even larger volumes of plastic waste,â€ she said. â€œWe are literally drowning in plastics.â€\r\n\r\nSince the coronavirus struck, recyclers worldwide told Reuters, their businesses have shrunk, by more than 20% in Europe, by 50% in parts of Asia and as much as 60% for some firms in the United States.\r\n\r\nGreg Janson, whose St. Louis, Missouri, recycling company QRS has been in business for 46 years, says his position would have been unimaginable a decade ago: The United States has become one of the cheapest places to make virgin plastic, so more is coming onto the market.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe pandemic exacerbated this tsunami,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe oil and chemicals companies that Reuters surveyed said plastic can be part of the solution to global challenges related to a growing population. Six said they were also developing new technologies to reuse waste plastic.\r\n\r\nSome said other packaging products can cause more emissions than plastics; because plastic is light, it is indispensable for the worldâ€™s consumers and can help reduce emissions. A few called on governments to improve waste management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nâ€œHigher production capacities do not necessarily mean more plastic waste pollution,â€ said a spokesman at BASF SE of Germany, the worldâ€™s biggest chemicals producer, adding that it has been innovating for many years in packaging materials to reduce the resources required.\r\n\r\nThe new plastic wave is breaking on shores across the globe.\r\n\r\nMAKE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nRichard Pontillas, 33, runs a family-owned â€œsari-sariâ€ or â€œsundriesâ€ store in Quezon City, the most populous metropolis in the Philippines. The liquid goods he sells used to be packaged in glass. Many customers, in fact, brought in their own bottles to be refilled.\r\n\r\nMerchants like him are among key targets for the plastic industry, looking to extend a trend established after 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland invented Bakelite. Since World War Two, mass-produced plastic has fuelled economic growth and spawned a new era of consumerism and convenience packaging.\r\n\r\nâ€œMany years ago ... we relied on goods repackaged in bottles and plastic bags,â€ said Pontillas, whose store sells rice, condiments and sachets of coffee, chocolate drink and seasonings.\r\n\r\nToday, thousands of small-scale vendors in the developing world stock daily goods in plastic pouches, or sachets, which hang in strips from the roofs of roadside shacks and cost a few cents a go.\r\n\r\nAlready, 164 million such sachets are used every day in the Philippines, according to the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, an NGO. Thatâ€™s nearly 60 billion a year.\r\n\r\nConsumer goods firms including Nestle and P&G say they are working hard to make their packaging either recyclable or reusable. For example, P&G said it has a project in schools in the Manila region which aims to collect one million sachets for â€œupcycling.â€\r\n\r\nBut sachets are very difficult to recycle. They are just one form of pollution that the pandemic is adding to, clogging drains, polluting water, suffocating marine life and attracting rodents and disease-carrying insects.\r\n\r\nSo are face masks, which are made partly from plastic.\r\n\r\nIn March, China used 116 million of them â€“ 12 times more than in February, official data show.\r\n\r\nTotal production of masks in China is expected to exceed 100 billion in 2020, according to a report by Chinese consultancy iiMedia Research. The United States generated an entire yearâ€™s worth of medical waste in two months at the height of the pandemic, according to another consultancy, Frost & Sullivan.\r\n\r\nEven as the waste mounts, much is at stake for the oil industry.\r\n\r\nExxon forecasts that demand for petrochemicals will rise by 4% a year over the next few decades, the company said in an investor presentation in March.\r\n\r\nAnd oilâ€™s share of energy for transport will fall from more than 90% in 2018 to just under 80% or as low as 20% by 2050, BP Plc said in its annual market report in September.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nOil companies worry that environmental concerns may blunt petrochemical growth.\r\n\r\nThe U.N. said last year that 127 countries have adopted bans or other laws to manage plastic bags. BPâ€™s chief economist Spencer Dale said in 2018 that global plastic bans could result in 2 million barrels per day of lower oil demand growth by 2040 â€“ around 2% of current daily demand. The company declined further comment.\r\n\r\nUSE PLASTIC\r\n\r\nThis year alone, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BASF have announced petrochemical plant investments in China worth a combined $25 billion, tapping into rising demand for consumer goods in the worldâ€™s most populous country.\r\n\r\nAn additional 176 new petrochemical plants are planned in the next five years, of which nearly 80% will be in Asia, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie says.\r\n\r\nIn the United States since 2010, energy companies have invested more than $200 billion in 333 plastic and other chemical projects, according to the American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry body.\r\n\r\nThose investments have come as the U.S. industry sought to capitalise on a sudden abundance of cheap natural gas released by the shale revolution.\r\n\r\nThe industry says disposable plastics have saved lives.\r\n\r\nâ€œSingle-use plastics have been the difference between life and death during this pandemic,â€ Tony Radoszewski, president and CEO of the Plastic Industry Association (PLASTICS), the industryâ€™s lobbying group in the United States, told Reuters. Bags for intravenous solutions and ventilators require single-use plastics, he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œHospital gowns, gloves and masks are made from safe, sanitary plastic.â€\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\r\n\r\nIn March, PLASTICS wrote to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling for a rollback of plastic bag bans on health grounds. It said plastic bags are safer because germs live on reusable bags and other substances.\r\n\r\nResearchers led by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a U.S. government agency, found later that month that the coronavirus was still active on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.\r\n\r\nThe industryâ€™s letter was part of a long-standing campaign for single-use material.\r\n\r\nThe ACCâ€™s managing director for plastics, Keith Christman, said the chemicals lobby is opposed to plastic bans because it believes consumers would switch to using other disposable materials like glass and paper, rather than reusing bags and bottles.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe challenge comes when you ban plastic but the alternative might not be a reusable product ... so it really wouldnâ€™t accomplish much,â€ Christman said.\r\n\r\nPlastic makes up 80% of marine debris, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, a global alliance backed by governments, NGOs and companies including Shell, which is also a member of the ACC.\r\n\r\nPlastic pollution has been shown to be deadly to turtles, whales and baby seals and releases chemicals that we inhale, ingest or touch that cause a wide range of harms including hormonal disruption and cancer, the United Nations says.\r\n\r\nRECYCLE?\r\n\r\nPlastic recyclers have faced new problems in the pandemic.\r\n\r\nDemand for recycled material from packaging businesses fell by 20% to 30% in Europe in the second quarter compared with the previous year, ICIS says.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, people who stayed at home created more recycling waste, said Sandra Castro, CEO of Extruplas, a Portuguese recycling firm which transforms recycled plastics into outdoor furniture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are many recycling companies that may not be able to cope,â€ she said. â€œWe need the industry to be able to provide a solution to the waste we produce.â€\r\n\r\nIn the United States, QRSâ€™s Janson said that for two months after the pandemic lockdowns, his orders were down 60% and he dropped his prices by 15%.\r\n\r\nAnd the pandemic has added to costs for big consumer companies that use recycled plastic.\r\n\r\nThe Coca-Cola Co told Reuters in September it missed a target to get recycled plastic into half its UK packaging by early 2020 due to COVID-19 delays. The company said it hopes now to meet that by November.\r\n\r\nCoca-Cola, Nestle and PepsiCo have been the worldâ€™s top three plastic polluters for two years running, according to a yearly brand audit by Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.\r\n\r\nThese companies have for decades made voluntary goals to increase recycled plastic in their products. They have largely failed to meet them. Coke and Nestle said it can be hard to get the plastic they need from recycled sources.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe often pay more for recycled plastic than we would if we purchased virgin plastic,â€ a Nestle spokesperson said, adding that investment in recycled material was a company priority.\r\n\r\nAsked how much they were investing in recycling and waste cleanup programmes, the three companies named initiatives totalling $215 million over a seven-year period.\r\n\r\nAt current investment levels in recycling, brands will not meet their targets, analysts at ICIS and Wood Mackenzie say.\r\n\r\nTOSS\r\n\r\nEven if existing recycling pledges are met, the plastic going into the oceans is on course to rise from 11 million tonnes now to 29 million by 2040, according to a study published in June by Pew Trusts, an independent public interest group.\r\n\r\nCumulatively, this would reach 600 million tonnes â€“ the weight of 3 million blue whales.\r\n\r\nIn response to mounting public concerns, the Alliance to End Plastic Waste says it will partner existing small-scale NGOs that clean up waste in developing countries.\r\n\r\nOne venture, which helps women earn money from selling plastic scrap in Ghana, says it has successfully diverted 35 tonnes of plastic from becoming litter since March 2017.\r\n\r\nThatâ€™s less than 0.01% of the annual plastic waste generated in Ghana, or 2% of the plastic waste that the United States exported to Ghana last year, according to World Bank and U.S. trade data.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe do realise change wonâ€™t happen overnight,â€ said Alliance president and CEO Jacob Duer. â€œWhat is important for us is that our projects are not seen as the end, but the beginning.â€\r\n\r\nIn the Philippines, Vietnam and India, as much as 80% of the recycling industry was not operating during the height of the pandemic. And there was a 50% drop in demand for recycled plastic on average across South and Southeast Asia, according to Circulate Capital, a Singapore-based investor in Asian recycling operations.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe combination of the impact of COVID-19 and low oil prices is like a double whammyâ€ for plastic recycling, said Circulateâ€™s CEO, Rob Kaplan.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re seeing massive disruption.â€', 0),

Things could look different in the annual meeting season starting next month, when companies are set to face the most investor resolutions tied to climate change in years.\r\n\r\nFILE PHOTO: Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg takes part in a climate strike protest during the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 24, 2020. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\r\n\r\nThose votes are likely to win more support than in previous years from large asset managers seeking clarity on how executives plan to adapt and prosper in a low-carbon world, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen activist investors and fund managers.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, shareholders have filed 79 climate-related resolutions so far, compared with 72 for all of last year and 67 in 2019, according to data compiled by the Sustainable Investments Institute and shared with Reuters. The institute estimated the count could reach 90 this year.\r\n\r\nTopics to be put to a vote at annual general meetings (AGMs) include calls for emissions limits, pollution reports and â€œclimate auditsâ€ that show the financial impact of climate change on their businesses.\r\n\r\nA broad theme is to press corporations across sectors, from oil and transport to food and drink, to detail how they plan to reduce their carbon footprints in coming years, in line with government pledges to cut emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nâ€œNet-zero targets for 2050 without a credible plan including short-term targets is greenwashing, and shareholders must hold them to account,â€ said billionaire British hedge fund manager Chris Hohn, who is pushing companies worldwide to hold a recurring shareholder vote on their climate plans.\r\n\r\nMany companies say they already provide plenty of information about climate issues. Yet some activists say they see signs more executives are in a dealmaking mood this year.\r\n\r\nRoyal Dutch Shell said on Feb. 11 it would become the first oil and gas major to offer such a vote, following similar announcements from Spanish airports operator Aena, UK consumer goods company Unilever and U.S. rating agency Moodyâ€™s.\r\n\r\nWhile most resolutions are non-binding, they often spur changes with even 30% or more support as executives look to satisfy as many investors as possible.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe demands for increased disclosure and target-setting are much more pointed than they were in 2020,â€ said Daniele Vitale, the London-based head of governance for Georgeson, which advises corporations on shareholder views.\r\n\r\nCOMPANIES WARM THE WORLD\r\n\r\nWhile more and more companies are issuing net-zero targets for 2050, in line with goals set out in the 2015 Paris climate accord, few have published interim targets. A study here from sustainability consultancy South Pole showed just 10% of 120 firms it polled, from varied sectors, had done so.\r\n\r\nâ€œThereâ€™s too much ambiguity and lack of clarity on the exact journey and route that companies are going to take, and how quickly we can actually expect movement,â€ said Mirza Baig, head of investment stewardship at Aviva Investors.\r\n\r\nData analysis from Swiss bank J Safra Sarasin, shared with Reuters, shows the scale of the collective challenge.\r\n\r\nSarasin studied the emissions of the roughly 1,500 firms in the MSCI World Index, a broad proxy for the worldâ€™s listed companies. It calculated that if companies globally did not curb their emissions rate, they would raise global temperatures by more than 3 degrees Celsius by 2050.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\r\n\r\nThat is well short of the Paris accord goal of limiting warming to â€œwell belowâ€ 2C, preferably 1.5C.\r\n\r\nAt an industry level, there are large differences, the study found: If every company emitted at the same level as the energy sector, for example, the temperature rise would be 5.8C, with the materials sector - including metals and mining - on course for 5.5C and consumer staples - including food and drink - 4.7C.\r\n\r\nThe calculations are mostly based on companiesâ€™ reported emissions levels in 2019, the latest full year analysed, and cover Scope 1 and 2 emissions - those caused directly by a company, plus the production of the electricity it buys and uses.\r\n\r\nâ€˜TAILWIND ON CLIMATEâ€™\r\n\r\nSectors with high carbon emissions are likely to face the most investor pressure for clarity.\r\n\r\nIn January, for example, ExxonMobil - long an energy industry laggard in setting climate goals - disclosed its Scope 3 emissions, those connected to use of its products.\r\n\r\nThis prompted the California Public Employeesâ€™ Retirement System (Calpers) to withdraw a shareholder resolution seeking the information.\r\n\r\nCalpersâ€™ Simiso Nzima, head of corporate governance for the $444 billion pension fund, said he saw 2021 as a promising year for climate concerns, with a higher likelihood of other companies also reaching agreements with activist investors.\r\n\r\nâ€œYouâ€™re seeing a tailwind in terms of climate change.â€\r\n\r\nHowever, Exxon has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to skip votes on four other shareholder proposals, three related to climate matters, according to filings to the SEC. They cite reasons such as the company having already â€œsubstantially implementedâ€ reforms.\r\n\r\nAn Exxon spokesman said it had ongoing discussions with its stakeholders, which led to the emissions disclosure. He declined to comment on the requests to skip votes, as did the SEC, which had not yet ruled on Exxonâ€™s requests as of late Tuesday.\r\n\r\nâ€˜A CRUMB BUT A SIGNâ€™\r\n\r\nGiven the influence of large shareholders, activists are hoping for more from BlackRock, the worldâ€™s biggest investor with $8.7 trillion under management, which has promised a tougher approach to climate issues.\r\n\r\nLast week, BlackRock called for boards to come up with a climate plan, release emissions data and make robust short-term reduction targets, or risk seeing directors voted down at the AGM.\r\n\r\nIt backed a resolution at Procter & Gambleâ€™s AGM, unusually held in October, which asked the company to report on efforts to eliminate deforestation in its supply chains, helping it pass with 68% support.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s a crumb but we hope itâ€™s a sign of things to comeâ€ from BlackRock, said Kyle Kempf, spokesman for resolution sponsor Green Century Capital Management in Boston.\r\n\r\nAsked for more details about its 2021 plans, such as if it might support Hohnâ€™s resolutions, a BlackRock spokesman referred to prior guidance that it would â€œfollow a case-by-case approach in assessing each proposal on its meritsâ€.\r\n\r\nEuropeâ€™s biggest asset manager, Amundi, said last week it, too, would back more resolutions.\r\n\r\nVanguard, the worldâ€™s second-biggest investor with $7.1 trillion under management, seemed less certain, though.\r\n\r\nLisa Harlow, Vanguardâ€™s stewardship leader for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, called it â€œreally difficult to sayâ€ whether its support for climate resolutions this year would be higher than its traditional rate of backing one in ten.\r\n\r\nâ€˜THERE WILL BE FIGHTSâ€™\r\n\r\nBritainâ€™s Hohn, founder of $30 billion hedge fund TCI, aims to establish a regular mechanism to judge climate progress via annual shareholder votes.\r\n\r\nIn a â€œSay on Climateâ€ resolution, investors ask a company to provide a detailed net zero plan, including short-term targets, and put it to an annual non-binding vote. If investors arenâ€™t satisfied, they will then be in a stronger position to justify voting down directors, the plan holds.\r\n\r\nEarly signs suggest the drive is gaining momentum.\r\n\r\nHohn has already filed at least seven resolutions through TCI. The Childrenâ€™s Investment Fund Foundation, which Hohn founded, is working with campaign groups and asset managers to file more than 100 resolutions over the next two AGM seasons in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia.\r\n\r\nâ€œOf course, not all companies will support the Say on Climate,â€ Hohn told pension funds and insurance companies in November. â€œThere will be fights, but we can win the votes.â€', 0);

The program, backed by Dow Inc, one of the worldâ€™s biggest plastics producers, was hailed locally as a greener alternative to burying it in the county landfill.\r\n\r\nBales of hard-to-recycle plastic waste are seen piled up at Renewlogy Technologies in Salt Lake City, Utah, U.S., on May 18, 2021. Picture taken May 18, 2021. REUTERS/George Frey\r\n\r\nA few months later, residents of Boise and its suburbs began stuffing their yogurt containers, cereal-box liners and other plastic waste into special orange garbage bags, which were then trucked more than 300 miles (483 kilometers) away, across the state line to Salt Lake City, Utah.\r\n\r\nThe destination was a company called Renewlogy. The startup marketed itself as an â€œadvanced recyclingâ€ company capable of handling hard-to-recycle plastics such as plastic bags or takeout containers - stuff most traditional recyclers wonâ€™t touch. Renewlogyâ€™s technology, company founder Priyanka Bakaya told local media at the time, would heat plastic in a special oxygen-starved chamber, transforming the trash into diesel fuel.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, that effort ground to a halt. The projectâ€™s failure, detailed for the first time by Reuters, shows the enormous obstacles confronting advanced recycling, a set of reprocessing technologies that the plastics industry is touting as an environmental savior - and sees as key to its own continued growth amid mounting global pressure to curb the use of plastic.\r\n\r\nRenewlogyâ€™s equipment could not process plastic â€œfilmsâ€ such as cling wrap, as promised, Boiseâ€™s Materials Management Program Manager Peter McCullough told Reuters. The city remains in the recycling program, he said, but its plastic now meets a low-tech end: Itâ€™s being trucked to a cement plant northeast of Salt Lake City that burns it for fuel.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said in an emailed response to Reutersâ€™ questions that it could recycle plastic films. The trouble, it said, was that Boiseâ€™s waste was contaminated with other garbage at 10 times the level it was told to expect.\r\n\r\nBoise spokesperson Colin Hickman said the city was not aware of any statements or assurances made to Renewlogy about specific levels of contamination.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag, as the recycling program in Boise is known, is a collaboration between Dow and U.S. packaging firm Reynolds Consumer Products Inc, maker of the programâ€™s orange garbage sacks and popular household goods such as Hefty trash bags, plastic food wrap and aluminum foil. Hefty EnergyBag said in an emailed response to questions that it â€œcontinues to work with companies to help advance technologies that enable other end uses for the collected plastics.â€ It declined to answer questions about Renewlogyâ€™s operations, as did Dow spokesperson Kyle Bandlow. Reynolds did not respond to requests for comment.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of Boiseâ€™s advanced recycling plan is not an isolated case. In the past two years, Reuters has learned, three separate advanced recycling projects backed by other major companies - in the Netherlands, Indonesia and the United States - have been dropped or indefinitely delayed because they were not commercially viable.\r\n\r\nIn all, Reuters examined 30 projects by two-dozen advanced recycling companies across three continents and interviewed more than 40 people with direct knowledge of this industry, including plastics industry officials, recycling executives, scientists, policymakers and analysts.\r\n\r\nMost of those endeavors are agreements between small advanced recycling firms and big oil and chemical companies or consumer brands, including ExxonMobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Procter & Gamble Co (P&G). All are still operating on a modest scale or have closed down, and more than half are years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans, according to the Reuters review. Three advanced recycling companies that have gone public in the last year have seen their stock prices decline since their market debuts.\r\n\r\nPLASTIC BOOM\r\n\r\nMany advanced recycling projects have emerged in recent years in response to a global explosion of plastic waste. More than 90% gets dumped or incinerated because thereâ€™s no cheap way to repurpose it, according to a landmark 2017 study published in the journal Science Advances.\r\n\r\nNot only is this garbage choking landfills and despoiling oceans, itâ€™s contributing to global warming because itâ€™s made from fossil fuels here. At a time when demand for transport fuel is under pressure from government vehicle-efficiency mandates and the rise of electric cars, the oil industry is doubling down on plastics. Plastic production - which industry analysts forecast to double by 2040 - will be the biggest growth market for oil demand over the next decade, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.\r\n\r\nA number of U.S. and European cities have already levied bans or consumer fees on single-use plastic bags. Pressure is also building for â€œpolluter-paysâ€ laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation.\r\n\r\nEnter advanced recycling. Also known as â€œchemical recycling,â€ advanced recycling is an umbrella term for processes that use heat or chemicals to turn plastic waste into fuel or reclaimed resin to make new plastic.\r\n\r\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy. Itâ€™s urging U.S. lawmakers instead to ease regulations on and provide incentives to advanced recycling companies.\r\n\r\nAs of July, 14 U.S. states had passed these kinds of laws. At least $500 million in public funds has been spent since 2017 on 51 U.S. advanced recycling projects, the environmental group Greenpeace said in a report last year. Boiseâ€™s government, for example, has spent at least $736,000 on garbage bags for its program, according to purchase orders and invoices between May 2018 and April 2020 obtained by Reuters through public records requests.\r\n\r\nThe ACC says these technologies are game-changers because they could potentially process all types of plastic, eliminating expensive sorting and cleaning.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe potential is enormous,â€ said Joshua Baca, vice president of the ACCâ€™s plastics division. The ACC this month called on Congress to develop a national strategy to reduce plastic waste, including â€œrapid scalingâ€ of advanced recycling.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Reuters review found some advanced recycling companies struggling with the same obstacles that have bedeviled traditional recyclers for decades: the expense of collecting, sorting and cleaning plastic trash, and creating end products that can compete on price and quality with fossil fuels or virgin plastic.\r\n\r\nTransitioning from the lab to the real-world chaos of dirty and improperly sorted household plastic waste has proven too much for some of these newcomers, said Helen McGeough, a London-based senior plastic recycling analyst at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, a data and analytics firm.\r\n\r\nâ€œPeople have entered into this, perhaps not understanding the processes properly, the waste that they are handling, and so thatâ€™s why some things have failed,â€ McGeough told Reuters.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling is in its infancy, and as with any emerging technology, setbacks are to be expected, a dozen industry players said.\r\n\r\nSo far, some of their own research shows itâ€™s no panacea.\r\n\r\nAn assessment of the Hefty EnergyBag program was commissioned by Reynolds. It compared the environmental impact of recycling plastic waste through a heating process known as pyrolysis - the approach Renewlogy used - to two traditional ways of handling it: burning it in cement kilns or putting it in a landfill.\r\n\r\nThe study, published on the Hefty EnergyBag programâ€™s website last year, found that in Boiseâ€™s case, pyrolysis fared worst among the three in terms of its overall global warming potential. That measure estimated the greenhouse gas emissions of the whole process, from manufacturing the garbage bags and transporting the waste to the energy used in the recycling process.\r\n\r\nA narrower analysis, looking just at the final recycling process and its contribution to global warming, found that pyrolysis scored better than landfilling but was worse than burning plastic in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œThese types of studies will really push the chemical recyclers to think about their operations,â€ said Tad Radzinski, president of Sustainable Solutions Corporation, the consultancy which conducted the study.\r\n\r\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\r\n\r\nThe study noted its calculations came from various sources, including a U.S.-based pyrolysis plant that has experience processing the Hefty EnergyBag materials. Asked whether Renewlogyâ€™s plant was the one it examined, Sustainable Solutions said it could not name the plant because of a non-disclosure agreement with that facility.\r\n\r\nReynolds and Dow had no comment about the study.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it supplied no data to Sustainable Solutions. â€œOur numbers are vastly different from those used in the report,â€ Renewlogy said in response to Reutersâ€™ questions.\r\n\r\nCASHING IN ON TRASH\r\n\r\nAdvanced recycling projects have mushroomed globally, especially since 2018. Thatâ€™s when China, once the top buyer of the worldâ€™s used plastic, banned these imports because its recyclers were overwhelmed. Other countries, too, are shutting their doors to foreign waste, putting pressure on the developed world to deal with its own garbage.\r\n\r\nThe boom is also being fueled by investors looking for the next hot green-tech industry.\r\n\r\nMost of the advanced recycling firms involved in the projects reviewed by Reuters use a form of pyrolysis, the process of breaking down matter using high temperatures in an environment with little or no oxygen.\r\n\r\nPyrolysis has been tried before on plastic. British oil giant BP Plc, German chemical maker BASF SE and U.S. oil company Texaco Inc - now owned by Chevron Corp - all separately dropped plans to scale up waste-to-fuel pyrolysis technologies more than 20 years ago due to technical and commercial problems.\r\n\r\nBASF said it now believes such an endeavor is viable. It said in October 2019 it invested 20 million euros in Quantafuel, a Norway-based plastic-to-fuel company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSome scientists challenge the assertion that melting unsorted plastic made from a variety of chemicals is good for the environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to consuming large amounts of energy, â€œpyrolysis can generate toxic waste, such as dioxins,â€ said Hideshige Takada, a geochemist and professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology who has studied pollutants in waste for decades.\r\n\r\nNor has pyrolysis proven capable of transforming unsorted garbage into high-quality fuel and clean plastic resin, says Susannah Scott, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who receives funding from the plastics industry to perform recycling research.\r\n\r\nPlastics have long been stamped with the numbers 1 to 7 inside the familiar â€œchasing arrowsâ€ logo to help traditional recyclers separate the waste before processing it.\r\n\r\nScott said melting different numbered plastics together through pyrolysis produces a complex blend of hydrocarbons that must then be separated and purified for reuse. That process requires a lot of energy, she said, and typically yields products that donâ€™t measure up to the quality of the original material.\r\n\r\nWith pyrolysis, â€œthe value of what youâ€™re making is so low,â€ Scott said.\r\n\r\nAdvanced recyclers say theyâ€™re overcoming these problems with innovations in energy efficiency and purification.\r\n\r\nOf two-dozen companies whose projects were reviewed by Reuters, three have gone public in the last year: PureCycle Technologies Inc, Agilyx AS and Pryme B.V.. The market value of all has declined since their debuts.\r\n\r\nOne of the hardest hit has been PureCycle, a Florida-headquartered advanced recycling startup that went public this year through a special purchase acquisition company. It ended its first day of trading on March 18 with shares up 13% to $33, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.8 billion.\r\n\r\nBut its shares tumbled 40% on May 6, the day short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling the recyclerâ€™s technology â€œunprovenâ€ and its financial projections â€œridiculous.â€ PureCycle shares have since regained some ground.\r\n\r\nPureCycle said the same day that Hindenburgâ€™s report was â€œdesigned to drive down the stock price in order to serve the short sellerâ€™s economic interests.â€ It declined further comment about the report.\r\n\r\nHindenburg declined to comment.\r\n\r\nAccording to its website, PureCycle uses a â€œground-breakingâ€ recycling process developed by P&G, maker of Gillette razors and Head & Shoulders shampoo, to turn a particular type of waste plastic, polypropylene, back into resin. PureCycle is around two years behind schedule on its first commercial plant, which its CEO Mike Otworth told Reuters on March 6 was due to slower-than-expected debt financing and the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nP&G declined to comment.\r\n\r\nThe ACC, the chemicals trade group, continues to promote the potential of advanced recycling. Last year, it spent $14 million lobbying members of Congress on various issues, the most the organization has ever spent, according to OpenSecrets.org, a non-profit initiative that tracks money in U.S. politics.\r\n\r\nUntil her two-year term ended in December, Renewlogyâ€™s Bakaya was the chair of the ACCâ€™s advanced recycling unit.\r\n\r\nONE TO WATCH\r\n\r\nBakaya grew up in Australia after her father emigrated there from India, she told business podcast Upside in 2020. She attended Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), graduating from the latter in 2011. She became a prominent figure in advanced recycling, promoting her technology on media forums such as National Geographic and the BBC.\r\n\r\nBakaya garnered a string of accolades, including making Fortuneâ€™s â€œ40 under 40: Ones to Watchâ€ list in 2013.\r\n\r\nShe declined to be interviewed for this story.\r\n\r\nBakaya said in a TEDx talk in 2015 that she initially set up a company called PK Clean to recover oil from â€œmixed, dirty landfill-bound plastic.â€ PK Clean later changed its name to Renewlogy, Bakaya said in an interview with MIT in 2017.\r\n\r\nSteve Case, co-founder and former chief executive of AOL Inc, invested $100,000 in PK Clean in 2016, according to a blog he authored on the website of his venture capital firm Revolution. The governorâ€™s office in Utah said it gave a total of $200,000 in grants in 2016 and 2017, while Salt Lake Cityâ€™s Department of Economic Development provided $350,000 in loans in 2015 to PK Clean, according to Peter Makowski, acting director of business development for the department.\r\n\r\nRevolution did not respond to requests for comment. The Utah governorâ€™s office said the program under which PK Clean received the grants had ended and it was no longer funding the company. Salt Lake City said its loans to PK Clean have been repaid.\r\n\r\nBoise first sent plastic waste to Renewlogy in June 2018, followed by at least five more truckloads in the following months, minutes of meetings of Boiseâ€™s Public Works Commission show. In June 2019, Boise said in a statement it had temporarily stopped sending its waste to Renewlogy while the Utah plant upgraded its equipment. Hefty EnergyBag said Renewlogy left the program for good in December 2020. Renewlogy did not respond to questions about how much of Boiseâ€™s plastic waste it had recycled.\r\n\r\nReuters made an unannounced visit to Renewlogyâ€™s Salt Lake City operation in mid-May. On a Monday afternoon, there was little visible activity outside the facility; the front parking lot contained five passenger cars, two of which had flat tires. The back lot contained dozens of bales of plastic waste dotted with faded orange recycling bags stacked next to rusty oil drums and a wheelbarrow full of glass jars containing a murky liquid.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy co-founder Benjamin Coates emerged from the building to speak to a reporter. Asked about the status of the company, Coates said opponents of chemical recycling were trying to damage the industry by pushing â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ about the technology. He directed further questions to Bakaya before telling Reuters to leave the premises.\r\n\r\nJeremiah Bates, owner of a tire shop next door to Renewlogy, said the recycling plant didnâ€™t appear to have been active for at least six months and that he had complained to Coates and the local fire marshal about the debris piling up out back.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy did not respond to questions about Batesâ€™ assertions.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from the Salt Lake City Fire Prevention Bureau, Jose Vila Trejo, visited the recycling facility on Feb. 12, according to his inspection report. Vila Trejo told Reuters that his tour of the plant turned up no fire hazard because there were no machines present that could generate heat, flames or sparks.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey were basically shut down,â€ Vila Trejo said. â€œThere was no equipment in there.â€\r\n\r\nRenewlogy confirmed to Reuters that Vila Trejo inspected the building in February. It said the facility had not shut down and that there was equipment at the site.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it shares the Salt Lake City premises with other companies that work on pyrolysis of wood and other waste, and that much of the junk Reuters saw on the back lot belonged to other firms that it declined to name. Renewlogy added that it continues to operate its plant as a testing facility to develop new plastic recycling technologies.\r\n\r\nReuters exclusively reported in January that an advanced plastic recycling project in India, which was a collaboration between Renewlogy and a charity funded by plastic makers, collapsed last year.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy later this year plans to launch another plastics recycling facility, this one in Phoenix, Arizona, according to its website. Joe Giudice, assistant public works director at the City of Phoenix, confirmed the facility was due to start being set up in August. More taxpayer money is due to flow to the company.\r\n\r\nThe Arizona Innovation Challenge, a state-funded program, in 2017 awarded Renewlogy a $250,000 grant, funds that will be dispersed when Renewlogy sets up in Phoenix, the Arizona Commerce Authority, which runs the program, told Reuters.\r\n\r\nGiudice said Phoenix would not be sending Renewlogy any film plastics due to uncertainty over whether they could be easily recycled.\r\n\r\nRenewlogy said it would be â€œstarting very smallâ€ and would be â€œvalidating each step before scaling up.â€\r\n\r\nBOUND FOR THE DEVILâ€™S SLIDE\r\n\r\nBack in Boise, the Hefty EnergyBag program continues, but Renewlogy is no longer involved. Waste in those orange Hefty bags now helps fuel the Devilâ€™s Slide, a cement plant in Morgan, Utah, part of the U.S. unit of Holcim, a European multinational firm. The company told Reuters it has been burning Boiseâ€™s plastic since March 2020 as a replacement for coal.\r\n\r\nHefty EnergyBag has forged similar arrangements with cement makers in Nebraska and Georgia, according to the environmental study of the program commissioned by Reynolds.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups tracking chemical pollutants say incinerating plastic this way produces significant carbon emissions and releases dioxins associated with the chemicals in the plastic. This is in no way â€œrecycling,â€ said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network (IPEN), a global network of public interest groups working to eliminate toxic pollutants.\r\n\r\nBandlow, the Dow spokesperson, said the Hefty EnergyBag program was helping to â€œtransform waste into valuable products.â€ He declined to respond to questions about the environmental impact of burning plastic in cement kilns.\r\n\r\nJocelyn Gerst, a spokesperson for Holcimâ€™s U.S. operations, said the emissions levels of the plastic waste it burns are â€œthe same or lower than traditional fuel,â€ and that it had a state permit to incinerate plastic. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it does not have any data to show that â€œsubstitution of plastic waste for coal makes a significant difference in air emissions.â€\r\n\r\nBack in Idaho, Anne Baxter Terribilini, a resident of Meridian, a Boise suburb, said she initially was eager to participate in the Hefty EnergyBag program, but was disillusioned to learn that her plastic waste now ends up in a cement kiln.\r\n\r\nâ€œI hate to feel like we are being lulled into complacency, believing that we are having a positive impact on the environment, when really we arenâ€™t,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nBoise officials said theyâ€™ve been transparent with the public about the handling of their plastic waste. Haley Falconer, Boiseâ€™s sustainability officer, said the city has learned from the setbacks. In hindsight, she said, it would have been better to build a customized recycling program with a local partner so that Boise could control where its waste was going.\r\n\r\nBut the city has no place else to put its plastic garbage, so itâ€™s sticking with the Hefty EnergyBag program, Boiseâ€™s McCullough said.', 0),

The mayors of 12 big cities in North America, Europe and Africa pledged on Tuesday to shift their money out of fossil fuels and into green energy, buildings, transport and other investments to help them recover from the pandemic and tackle climate change.\r\n\r\nThe group of cities, which signed up to a declaration committing them to divest from coal, oil and gas, are home to more than 36 million residents and hold over $295 billion in assets.\r\n\r\nLed by London and New York City, they agreed to take all possible steps to divest from fossil fuel companies the assets that they control directly, while also calling on pension funds managing their money to do the same.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s time for cities to ditch fossil fuel investments and accelerate green investments that drive low-carbon jobs,â€ said London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn London, we have demonstrated that divestment is possible and indeed essential for our future,â€ he added in a statement.\r\n\r\nKhan committed in 2016 to work with the London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA) - the cityâ€™s largest local government pension provider - to move its assets out of fossil fuel firms.\r\n\r\nThe authority has since reduced its holdings in companies including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Coal India.\r\n\r\nThe share of the LPFAâ€™s assets invested in climate-polluting businesses has dropped from 1%, or Â£43.6 million ($56 million), to about 0.2% now, according to the Greater London Authority.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the LPFA has increased its green investments from Â£93 million to about Â£135 million, representing close to 3% of its assets today, city hall officials said.\r\n\r\nShirley Rodrigues, Londonâ€™s deputy mayor for environment and energy, said the aim was to divest 100% of the cityâ€™s pension funds from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nBut she noted that many cities, like London, have limited control over the management of their assets and cannot achieve a transformation overnight.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe key thing is understanding where your portfolio is and where you can act, and then taking those steps (to divest),â€ she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\r\n\r\nCities can find guidance on how to do that in a toolkit launched by London and New York last year, she added.\r\n\r\nThe other cities joining the divestment declaration are: Berlin, Bristol in England, South Africaâ€™s Cape Town and Durban, Los Angeles, Milan, New Orleans, Oslo, Pittsburgh and Vancouver.\r\n\r\nDurban Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda said the city - officially called eThekwini - had embedded its divestment commitment in a new climate action plan announced this month.\r\n\r\nThe funds freed up by the move would be used to help small and medium businesses, social enterprises and co-operatives to participate in the green economy, he added in written comments.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL SENSE\r\n\r\nThe C40 network of cities working on climate action - a group nearly all of the divesting cities belong to - said it was not possible to give an exact figure of how much will be divested from fossil-fuel companies across the 12 signatory cities.\r\n\r\nThat is because the proportion of fossil-fuel holdings within total assets varies for each city, and the decision-making power often lies with pension fund managers, over which cities have differing levels of influence, C40 said.\r\n\r\nBut greening investments made financial as well as climate sense, the group said in a statement.\r\n\r\nEurope-based sustainable funds are estimated to yield average returns of 6.9% per year, compared with 6.3% for traditionally invested funds, according to investment firm Morningstar, C40 noted.\r\n\r\nVancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said that his city council had passed a motion in 2019 committing to responsibly divest city funds and staff pensions from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nâ€œCities like Vancouver play a key role in creating forward-looking policies that transition us from fossil-fuel dependency to renewable energy and a less energy-intensive future,â€ the Canadian mayor said in the C40 statement.\r\n\r\nRodrigues said London sought to incorporate climate action throughout its policies - from housing to creating employment in new areas such as retrofitting buildings to save on energy, and expanding electrification of transport.\r\n\r\nIt also works to persuade private financial institutions based in the city to put more capital into low-carbon investments through instruments like green bonds or the London Energy Efficiency Fund set up by the mayor, she said.\r\n\r\nWhile some cities need time to put in place the necessary conditions to shift their assets out of fossil fuels, â€œthe willingness is thereâ€, she added.\r\n\r\n($1 = 0.7783 pounds)', 0),

REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin (RUSSIA)/File Photo\r\n\r\nLockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19, the flu-like infection caused by the virus, have snarled the supply of spare parts and have prevented maintenance workers from doing their job.\r\n\r\nRegular repairs are needed to keep wells pumping, pipelines and refineries functioning and ships moving. Without maintenance, the risk of glitches or unplanned outages increases and delays risk driving up the cost of work later - partly because there will be a rush to do maintenance when lockdowns ease, and partly because plants have lost the optimal timing and weather for work during the northern hemisphere spring.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen the virus and the quarantine measures have been eased and it is safe to get back to work, it doesnâ€™t mean the same work can be done with the same intensity because the weather windows could be missed and that can push maintenance even to the next year,â€ said Matthew Fitzsimmons, Vice President of the Oilfield Service team at research firm Rystad.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, companies which service the oil industry are being hit by the lack of work.\r\n\r\nâ€œA lot of service companies are not getting the revenues they had otherwise expected in 2020. That is going to have a huge impact on the health of the service industry,â€ said Fitzsimmons.\r\n\r\nA MAJOR HEADACHE\r\n\r\nOil and gas companies involved in exploration and production spent an average of $80 billion a year on maintenance between 2015 and 2019, according to Rystad.\r\n\r\nThe industry typically takes advantage of periods of slow demand to do repair work but with oil prices nearly halved since the start of the year, this is no ordinary trough. Companies, many of them lumbered with high debts, are slashing all but the most essential work.\r\n\r\nSome units were shut down for maintenance but the work never started according to Amanda Fairfax, downstream oil market analyst at Genscape, a firm that monitors refineries activities with cameras.\r\n\r\nâ€œThey donâ€™t want either to invest the capital expenditure into the maintenance project or they donâ€™t want to have as many contract workers on sites as the additional influx of workforce might compromise people who have to remain at the refinery as essential personnel,â€ she said.\r\n\r\nA large maintenance programme in Russiaâ€™s Far East Sakhalin-2 project faces delays as the firm could not get pre-ordered pieces of machinery, two sources told Reuters.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere was a major headache with parts manufactured in China. After the coronavirus outbreak there, the supplier told us it couldnâ€™t deliver our order. There are attempts to replace it, but the time has been lost,â€ an industry source told Reuters.\r\n\r\nSakhalin Energy told Reuters that the company operates according to a long-term maintenance plan, which is being constantly revised.\r\n\r\nâ€œAll works will be carried out in accordance with up-to-date plans, safety instructions and quarantine measures required by the state authorities,â€ the companyâ€™s representative said in an email.\r\n\r\nIts neighbour, Sakhalin-1 project, operated by ExxonMobil XOM.N, also said earlier this month that it was adjusting the schedule and scope of work at the plant.\r\n\r\nâ€œTo ensure the safety of our personnel ... we are focusing on those activities, which can be executed safely in the current COVID-19 situation and are essential for our continued economic and operational resilience,â€ ExxonMobil said.\r\n\r\nReuters has identified nearly a dozen companies whose maintenance and development plans have been affected by lockdowns.\r\n\r\n(Graphic: Impact of Covid-19 on oil projects - )\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN CONNECTION\r\n\r\nThe lockdown in Italy, which has suffered one of the worst virus outbreaks globally, has reverberated across the energy sector because the country is a leading valve manufacturer.\r\n\r\nAn industry source in Milan told Reuters that until recently less than 10 percent of Italian producers remained active, struggling to supply even strategic valves to overseas clients.\r\n\r\nItaly eased its coronavirus lockdown early in May, giving factories the green light to restart production lines.\r\n\r\nOne energy company in Nigeria said it was hoping to receive valves from its Italian supplier soon as they had been first in line when the shutdown began, the source said. But others are less optimistic.\r\n\r\nA maintenance and development operation at an onshore field in Nigeria was delayed for months as the local oil firm could not receive equipment on time, a company source told Reuters.\r\n\r\nOil companies across Nigeria have also struggled to move workers to where they are needed due to lockdowns that vary by state, and regulations from the petroleum regulator limiting the number of workers at any oil site is also complicating operations. Rivers state, home to the oil hub of Port Harcourt, is under a lockdown so strict that the governor arrested 22 oil workers who landed there, despite federal government permits allowing them to travel.\r\n\r\nThe Rivers movement restrictions have also trapped pipes and other needed materials that are needed at oil fields outside the state, industry sources told Reuters.\r\n\r\n(Graphic: Impact of Covid-19 on European refineries - )', 0);
